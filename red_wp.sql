Now you can add blocks both in widget areas across your site and with live preview through the Customizer. This opens up new possibilities to create content: from no-code mini layouts to the vast library of core and third-party blocks. For our developers, you can find more details in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/block-based-widgets-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\">Widgets dev note</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Display Posts with New Blocks and Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Query Loop Block makes it possible to display posts based on specified parameters; like a PHP loop without the code. Easily display posts from a specific category, to do things like create a portfolio or a page full of your favorite recipes. Think of it as a more complex and powerful Latest Posts Block! Plus, pattern suggestions make it easier than ever to create a list of posts with the design you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Edit the Templates Around Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the familiar block editor to edit templates that hold your content—simply activate a block theme or a theme that has opted in for this feature. Switch from editing your posts to editing your pages and back again, all while using a familiar block editor. There are more than 20 new blocks available within compatible themes.

As blocks increase, patterns emerge, and content creation gets easier, new solutions are needed to make complex content easy to navigate. List View is the best way to jump between layers of content and nested blocks. Since the List View gives you an overview of all the blocks in your content, you can now navigate quickly to the precise block you need. Ready to focus completely on your content? Toggle it on or off to suit your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Suggested Patterns for Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in this release the Pattern Transformations tool will suggest block patterns based on the block you are using. Right now, you can give it a try in the Query Block and Social Icon Block. As more patterns are added, you will be able to get inspiration for how to style your site without ever leaving the editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style and Colorize Images</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorize your image and cover blocks with duotone filters! Duotone can add a pop of color to your designs and style your images (or videos in the cover block) to integrate well with your themes. You can think of the duotone effect as a black and white filter, but instead of the shadows being black and the highlights being white, you pick your own colors for the shadows and highlights. There’s more to learn about how it works in the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:32px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">For Developers to Explore</h2>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"632\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=632%2C378&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10992\" srcset=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=1024%2C613&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=300%2C179&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=768%2C459&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=1536%2C919&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=2048%2C1225&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?w=1264&amp;ssl=1 1264w, https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?w=1896&amp;ssl=1 1896w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 632px) 100vw, 632px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<div style=\"height:16px\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Theme.json</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing the Global Styles and Global Settings APIs: control the editor settings, available customization tools, and style blocks using a theme.json file in the active theme.

to all of the community volunteers who contribute in the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a>. They answer questions from people across the world, whether they are using WordPress for the first time, or they’ve been around since the first release all the way back in 2003. These releases are as successful as they are because of their efforts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, thanks to all the community translators who help make WordPress available in over 200 languages for every release. 80 languages have translated 80% or more WordPress 5.8 and our community translators are hard at work ensuring more languages are on their way. If contributing to WordPress appeals to you, it’s easy to learn more.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And before we get started, I have to be honest with you all, this episode and the next one have made me feel really anxious. This one is about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in open source, and especially in WordPress. And the next one is about accessibility in WordPress. And I feel like there&#8217;s just so much to do, and we don&#8217;t do enough, but we do what we can. And still, we will never be done with that work. And if you don&#8217;t know what I mean by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, you can kind of think of it this way. Diversity is bringing in people with different viewpoints and lived experiences. Equity is making sure everyone has what they need to get a fair chance of success, which is different from equality. And Inclusion is making sure that the environment is built to not only tolerate diverse groups but to celebrate them as well. So remember this as you listen to what I have to say here. We are never where we want to be in either of those spaces. But that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from looking at the things we have done to get us in the right direction. All right. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say a lot that we are a project that serves a majority collection of minority voices. WordPress is global in reach and open source in nature. And you would assume that what allows the software to be used by anyone would also enable it to be built by anyone. After all, your location doesn&#8217;t matter, and who employs you also doesn&#8217;t matter. And your relative social standing certainly shouldn&#8217;t matter. As long as you can communicate with the others contributing to the project, there should be no obstacle to your participation. The mission of the WordPress project is to democratize publishing, right? It&#8217;s to get the ability to have a website tap into passive income on your web presence. I mean, the job is to level the playing field for everyone. However, it&#8217;s my experience that bringing in new voices takes a lot of proactive work on behalf of leaders and contributors. It&#8217;s not enough to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m having a party,&#8221; you also have to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having a party, and I&#8217;d like you to be there.&#8221; It&#8217;s not enough to think people will make their own space at this table. You have to make sure that you have table settings for everyone. And even beyond the basics of directing people to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on toward the next steps, you have to be honest about the fact that open source contribution requires a fair amount of privilege. By privilege, I mean the luxury of extra time or extra funding or just an understanding employer. WordPress supports 41% of the web. I think it&#8217;s 42% of the web right now. But less than 1% of people who use WordPress show up to help maintain it. And that 1% that does show up skews toward people who already have a pretty high level of representation and technology. And so, when you look at who is building it versus who is using it, it doesn&#8217;t always match. And since what we build so frequently reflects who we are, sometimes what we build doesn&#8217;t match the needs of the people who are using what we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what has WordPress done to be proactive on the question of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? There are quite a few unseen things that have gone into this over the years and a few pretty visible things. This is a very long list. And it has a whole lot of just reference material. And so the show notes today will come in handy for people, and there will be just a laundry list of linked resources for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first thing that WordPress has done is that we have accepted the burden of proof. I&#8217;m going to share a post about this in the show notes. That means we accept that it&#8217;s not the job of underrepresented folks to figure out if they are welcome. It&#8217;s up to us to make it clear that they are. So, there are three big little things that the community has done over the years. One is that many teams open their text-based meetings with an explanation of what is done in the meeting, who comes to the meetings, where to find help if you&#8217;re lost in the meeting, and for teams that have a specific type of requests that comes into those channels that aren&#8217;t handled in those channels. They also will share where people can go to get those requests taken care of. Many teams have also updated their team handbooks to have good beginner docs, limited use of inside jokes or jargon, and good first bugs. And also, there is a code of conduct in the community declaring that everyone is welcome and clarifies what to do if you see folks being unwelcoming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second big thing that folks in the WordPress community have done is written down what was unwritten. Having things clearly documented unlocks institutional knowledge that you&#8217;d otherwise have to know someone to get. Clarity and process and the structure help anyone engage with your organization, not just the people who have extra time to figure things out. What that looks like in the WordPress project is that many teams have documented their workflows and their working spaces and just their general team norms. Many teams have also started defining what it means to be a team rep and holding open processes to choose those team reps. Many other community leaders and I have written down countless unspoken rules, guidelines, and philosophical underpinnings so that people don&#8217;t have to guess what we&#8217;re doing or why we&#8217;re doing things, or where we want to do them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the more visible thing that the WordPress project has been doing is that we found ways to invite people in, and they&#8217;re not failsafe; they’re not foolproof, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. The first one is an ongoing, diverse speaker training initiative. And I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes as well. It is run by Jill Binder and a fantastic group of contributors that collaborate with her. And I really have loved watching that particular program grow and flourish and help WordPress make a difference where we absolutely can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that was pretty visible about how we invited people in was at the end of 2020, and we had an all-women and nonbinary release squad for our biggest release of the year; WordPress 5.6. I had a group of probably 70 women and nonbinary identifying folx who joined in the process and joined in learning more about the process. Some of them have continued in the project. Others have stepped away for various reasons. But all of them are welcome to return. And I encourage everyone to return to contribution when time and resources make that possible for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that we&#8217;ve done, which I have talked about a lot, is the revival of the testing and triage practices. That has been work that&#8217;s been ongoing for a number of years. And it happens across multiple teams. It is not always immediately clear to people why the testing work. And the triage work is identifiable for me as a way to invite people into this process. And so I&#8217;ll be briefly clear about it right now. So testing as a practice brings in the users that otherwise don&#8217;t have a lot of spare time and that extra privilege to like, figure out what&#8217;s going on with WordPress, and contribute their own fixes to problems. They can give back to this project by being co-developers with us, co-creators with our entire process of making WordPress real and usable for the largest number of people that we can because we now support 42% of the web. And then, the triage practice invites in a diverse voice of people. Because you don&#8217;t necessarily always need to know everything about a project to help with triage. And when you&#8217;re helping with triage, you get active learning through participating in the process. But you also get passive learning from the people who already know huge amounts about the project and the process and everything that goes into it. And so it&#8217;s a low key low stress way to get your feet wet and start building that knowledge that sometimes is hard to come by unless you are actively working in it. So the testing practices, the triage practices, I really to the core of my being believe that those are active and ongoing ways for us to invite people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to get their voices heard in an open source project. And y&#8217;all, as I said at the start, y’all, there&#8217;s nothing about this list that I just shared, which makes me feel like our work on this is done. Just like any muscle, you don&#8217;t fight to peak fitness, and then hit the big stop button on time and say, &#8220;Now, I never have to work out again.&#8221; If we did, the world would be a very different place probably. But it does then lead us to the next steps for fostering a community culture that&#8217;s as broad as the people who use this software. If you believe in leadership at any level, as I do, there are a ton of things that you can do right now. But I&#8217;ll boil them down into three big chunks of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, check your community area, or whatever community you want to apply this to, for things that need a little more proactive work. I will share a post called<em> Building A Culture of Safety</em> that will take you through a list of good first steps. And it is not as hard as it looks. When you say build a culture of safety, there are many really clear-cut minor changes that you can ask people to make and, in like, four or five different areas that can help your community be more welcoming and more open.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do is know that small changes add up over time and commit to making those changes where you can. If you are elite at any level, you know that supporting people and processes is the responsibility of everyone in the group. And if you can make your own autonomous decisions and commit to making small changes that make a big difference over time, you will be part of that solution. And that is not specific to any one group that we have in our communities. You can be an ally for anyone, whether they look like you, whether they have your same experiences, or not. And sometimes, it&#8217;s as easy as just holding space for the people who haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk yet. And on the subject of holding space and the way that we communicate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that I think is incredibly important is that you can take on as a foundational personal practice the concept of ethical communication. I&#8217;ll share a post about that as well in the show notes, but the core of it is that you have to know that what you say and don&#8217;t say what you do and don&#8217;t do has an impact on others and embrace that responsibility. All right, so you made it all the way through, and I am so proud of you. I&#8217;m sure you have questions about this. And I encourage you to share those. You can email them to me at wp briefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got two things for you today. First and foremost, WordPress 5.8 gets released tomorrow. It&#8217;s a big release, and lots of people have been working on it. So get your update processes ready and keep an eye on wordpress.org/news for the announcement post. Second, and still pretty important, team reps have been working on their quarterly check-ins so that all other teams can get an idea of what&#8217;s happening around the WordPress office. Keep an eye out for that post on make.wordpress.org/updates. And that is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re talking about one of my favorite parts of the project &#8211; WordPress events. The in-person component of the project is the dark matter that helps us build resilience and thrive as a group. A lot of what I&#8217;m going to share applies to every WordPress event, whether it&#8217;s a meetup or workshop, a contributor day, any other sort of format. But I&#8217;ll be focused on WordCamps. It&#8217;s been a while since we had any in-person WordCamps. Our last two were WordCamp Malaga in Spain and WordCamp Greenville in the US. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped anyone from gathering people together online. Which honestly makes a lot of sense for WordPress. Because there are many reasons we gather, the main three reasons are connecting, inspiring, and contributing. It&#8217;s true. It says so right in our documentation, &#8220;paper rustling.&#8221; All WordPress events should connect WordPress users, inspire people to do more with WordPress, and contribute to the WordPress project. As an aside, I&#8217;ll tell you that some groups also get to collaborate and educate in there, but connect, inspire, contribute. Those are the big three. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about today. And if you subscribe to this podcast for the back office deep cuts, I&#8217;ll also have a few of those for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so first up, connect. WordCamps are generally annual-ish gatherings organized by local WordPress meetup groups. They&#8217;re not meant to be big or fancy. The definition of the minimum viable product for WordCamp is 50 people gathered all day to talk about WordPress. They are intentionally affordable to allow people from all walks of life to attend, meet, share and learn. This is made possible by donations and sponsorships from local businesses and larger businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. And this helps us get people connected to those in their community that works with or are sustained by WordPress. That connection feeds into the overall health of the global WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is inspire. WordCamps do not discriminate. They are open to any WordPress users, developers, designers, or other enthusiasts, regardless of their level of experience. And because of this, sessions generally span a variety of formats. So presentations or live demos to workshops or panels, any other format you can think of. But that also means that there are a variety of skill levels represented. There&#8217;s always content about how to use WordPress. That’s a given. But you can also count on content that inspires people to do more with their own dreams and aspirations. When I was still organizing WordCamps, my favorite thing was seeing people who came back year after year, putting into practice something that they learned the year before. It is that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> aspect to WordCamps that lets people see the edge of their ideas and then expand that just a little bit further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, contribute. WordCamps often have a contribution component to them. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a talk telling you how you can get more involved in the WordPress project. But sometimes, it&#8217;s a whole contributor day. And those range in size from single focus, like everyone, will show up and learn how to review a theme or a focus from every team that we have, like at the big flagship events where we gather hundreds of people into a room just to contribute to WordPress and all of the teams that go with it. Getting started with contributing can be daunting, but it is also essential to avoid something called the Tragedy of the Commons, an economic concept. So I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes below. But the most important thing, the most important thing to remember, is that WordPress is open source. And we asked people to help us keep this great tool running by giving back a little bit of their time if they have gotten any benefit from the WordPress project or CMS over the course of their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. The three big things you can get from a WordCamp. I know that I can&#8217;t wait to get back to them myself because while a lot of these things can still happen online and do, it&#8217;s really hard to replace the dark matter of in-person connections for open source projects. And since we&#8217;re talking dark matter anyway, let&#8217;s dig into it a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the section, I mentioned that WordCamps are local, locally organized, and people are encouraged to attend locally. But I am part of a group that ends up traveling to a lot of WordCamps. If you don&#8217;t know about the unseen work of WordPress, this raises eyebrows. So here is some clarification around the back office work that some of these traveling WordCampers often do. When I listed these out, there were about 20 different tasks, 20 different jobs, which was, frankly, a bit overwhelming when I listed them that way. So I&#8217;ve grouped them into kind of two genres, each with a group of current versus future types of work. So my two big buckets, big picture stuff, and then community stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big picture stuff, our first big genre here, when you&#8217;re looking at current topics, current issues kind of information, when we&#8217;re working on big picture stuff, you get the clarification of the mission or vision of WordPress, the sharing of open source methods or processes that we use in the WordPress project, and also sometimes those goal-setting conversations that you have to have both because we have a bunch of teams and team reps, that have a lot of really great ideas about what can be done in their teams to help WordPress succeed. But then also, because when you are working, when you&#8217;re contributing to a single team in the project, it can sometimes be hard to know how your work relates to the overall goals and visions of WordPress. And so that&#8217;s part of the work that gets done that I do there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you&#8217;re looking at future topics, future issues, the second part of this genre, that stuff like starting conversations or discussions around what the future holds for WordPress, and that&#8217;s the project as well as the technology or hearing from people about big things coming up for them. And any content that can support it, anything that I can provide to support those big things. It&#8217;s also a good time for me and others to identify trends based on what I see in presentations or what I hear from people at social functions. Really, it&#8217;s just a huge opportunity for information gathering to make sure that I know what everyone else in the project is trying to do and if they understand what the project is trying to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second big genre of things that happen in that dark matter kind of work at WordCamps is what I call community stewardship—so taking care of the community itself for the project itself. And a lot of that work is actually incident response kind of work. So conflict resolution, mediation often happens at in-person events, but also uncovering the shared foundations, the shared understanding for upcoming changes. So a lot of really, in the weeds kind of change management work. And for me, it&#8217;s certainly doing my best as a cultural liaison when I do see that there has been some miscommunication or gathering context for the latest disagreement that people are having with me so that I can clarify anything that was misunderstood from what I said. And also a little bit of policy clarification, just explaining why we do things and the way we do them. So for community stewardship, that&#8217;s kind of the current stuff that we look at. And that I do when I&#8217;m traveling for WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the future tasks that we do with community stewardship in the project, that stuff like training, and that&#8217;s training team reps, community deputies, or new contributors like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not really one type of training, necessarily. But then also, all of the checking in with our organizers, team reps, volunteers, sponsors, everyone like that, to make sure that what we have in the project and what&#8217;s happening in the project, the tools that we have, the experience that contributors have while they are working here, and WordPress is good, and is what they need. We&#8217;ve got a lot of tools to get things done in WordPress, and we can always make them better. And so checking in with people to kind of see how those processes are, how the tools are making sure that I have an idea of where our holes are and what needs to be patched, and how we can patch them in the long run. So that&#8217;s all of the future planning kind of work and topic stuff, just you know, making sure that WordPress has what it needs to survive long into the future and long after I&#8217;m doing anything with it, and long after you&#8217;re doing anything with it either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, lots and lots of unseen work being done at our in-person events. But folks who keep a keen eye on the online global work of WordPress will probably recognize that a lot of that work is also done routinely on make.wordpress.org and within the making WordPress Slack. There’s just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s just something different about receiving information from a human being with a face rather than an avatar with a photo. So I guess at the end of the day, that means the dark matter that keeps open source together is really an issue of communication. And you&#8217;ll get no arguments for me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And there&#8217;s really just one big thing. And that&#8217;s WordPress 5.8. We are about two weeks away from this big release; the community has been working tirelessly on it. And it&#8217;s shaping up to be one of the most tested releases that we&#8217;ve had in a long time. Myself, I&#8217;m grateful to see so much activity before the release. Since 5.8 and 5.9 releases represent such monumental shifts in our software, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to see so much activity prior to the release, especially in the beta period. We&#8217;ve been testing everything for it feels like six or eight months, and we&#8217;re really starting to see the positive benefits of that. And I think that we, the WordPress community, should be really proud of everything that we&#8217;re going to ship in 2021. Okay, so that was less of a small list of big things and really like one big thing with a generous garnish of encouragement, but you deserve it. So thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"The Month in WordPress: June 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 15:11:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10896\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:334:\"Once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:40</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A couple of weeks ago, we hosted WordCamp Europe and had the double pleasure of a demo that showed us a bit about the future of WordPress and an interview that looked back while also looking a bit forward. If you haven&#8217;t seen the demo, it was beautiful. And I&#8217;ve included a link to it in the show notes. And if you haven&#8217;t heard the interview, there were a few specific moments that I&#8217;d like to take the time to delve into a little more. Brian Krogsgard, in his conversation with Matt Mullenweg, brought up three really interesting points. I mean, he brought up a lot of interesting points, but there were three that I would particularly like to look into today. The first was about balance. The second was about cohesion. And the third was about those we leave behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 01:24</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first is this question of balance. Brian brought this up in the context of the overall economic health of the WordPress ecosystem. And in that particular moment, he talked about companies that are coming together, companies that are merging. And in Matt&#8217;s answer, the part that I found the most interesting was when he said, &#8220;the point at which there is the most commercial opportunity is also the point at which there is the most opportunity for short-termism. He went on to talk about the importance of long-term thinking and collective thinking about what makes us, and us here means probably the WordPress project, more vibrant and vital in 10 or 20 or 30 years. One of the things that he specifically called out in that answer was the responsibility of larger companies in the ecosystem. For instance, like Automattic, to commit fully to giving back, there are many ways now that companies can give back to WordPress so that we all replenish the Commons. They can pay for volunteer contributors&#8217; time; they can create and sponsor entire teams through the Five for the Future program. They can contribute time through our outreach program. And they can even contribute to WordPress&#8217;s ability to own our own voice by engaging their audience&#8217;s awareness of what&#8217;s next in WordPress, or whatever. And I know this balance, this particular balance of paid contributors or sponsored contributors, compared to our volunteer contributors or self-sponsored contributors; I know that this balance is one that people keep an eagle eye on. I am consistently on a tight rope to appropriately balanced those voices. But as with so many things where balance is key, keeping an eye on the middle or the long-distance can really help us get it right.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 03:23</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second question was one of cohesion and specifically cohesion over the competition. Brian asked how, if people feel disadvantaged, you can foster a feeling of cohesion rather than competition? And Matt&#8217;s first answer was that competition is great. Specifically, he said that competition is great as long as you consider where your collaboration fits into the mission. And he also spent some time exploring how competitors in the ecosystem can still work from a community-first mindset. I personally cannot agree enough about some of the benefits of collaboration alongside your competitors. I remind sponsored contributors from time to time, and I think it&#8217;s true for any contributor that you are an employee of your company first and a contributor to WordPress second. However, once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project. So you get all this subject matter expertise from competitive forces, collaborating in a very us versus the problem way. And when you do that, you&#8217;re always going to find a great solution. It may not be as fast as you want it to build things out in the open in public. And so sometimes we get it wrong and have to come back and fix it but still, given time, we&#8217;re going to come out with the best solution because we have so many skilled people working on this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 05:01</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third question that I wanted to really touch on is the question of those we leave behind. Brian asked Matt if he thought mid-sized agencies and mid-sized consultants were being squeezed out with the block editor. Matt&#8217;s high-level answer was no, and I tend to agree with him. It&#8217;s not all mid-sized anything any more than it&#8217;s all small-sized anything. His answer continued to look at what stands to change for users with the block editor and who really can stand to benefit. It made me think back to my WordPress 5.0 listening tour. We launched WordPress 5.0, which was, in case anyone forgets, the first release with the block editor in it. I took a six-month-long tour to anywhere that WordPressers were so I could hear their main worries, what Brian is saying in there, and what Matt is saying to really came up all the time in those conversations. And basically, it was that this update takes all the power away from people who are building websites. And in these conversations, and Matt and Brian&#8217;s conversation, it was really focused on our freelancers and consultants. But at the same time, all of them heard that this update gives power back to all of the people who could build websites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 06:28</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could not shake the feeling at the time. And honestly, I can&#8217;t shake it now that no high-end consultants, or freelancers, or any other developer or site creator sit around just longing for maintenance work. After six months of talking to people, I didn&#8217;t hear anyone say, &#8220;you know, I just love making the same author card over and over and over.&#8221; Or, &#8220;updated the footer every week, this month. And that&#8217;s why I got into this business.&#8221; And more than the feeling that there just wasn&#8217;t anyone who just loved maintenance, I got a feeling that there were real problems that needed to be solved for these clients and that they wanted to solve them. And that they also would gladly trade updating footers for the much more interesting work of creating modern and stylish business hubs based on WordPress for the clients who trust them so much. All of that, I guess, is to say that, yes, the block editor does give power back to our clients again, but not at the expense of those who have to build the sites in the first place. I think it stands to restore everyone&#8217;s sense of agency more than we truly realize. So that&#8217;s my deep dive on WordCamp Europe; I included links to the demo and the talk below, just in case you haven&#8217;t seen them yet. And you want to get a little bit of insight into the full context of the conversations that I just did a bit of a deep dive into.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy 08:15</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our smallest of big things. All right, I have three things for you today. Number one, tomorrow, we package WordPress 5.8 beta three. If you&#8217;ve never had a chance to stop by the core channel in slack for the past packaging process, I really encourage you to stop by; we call them release parties. It&#8217;s a bunch of people who stand around and help get it done. So you can also see how it gets done. And if you&#8217;re feeling brave, you can even try your hand at testing out one of the packages as soon as it&#8217;s ready. The second thing is that a week from tomorrow, we reach our first release candidate milestone. So if you have meant to submit any bugs or patches or if you&#8217;ve been procrastinating on documentation, or dev notes, right now is the time so that we can have a chance to get everything into the release by the time we reach the release candidate milestone on the 29th. And the third thing is that we are currently right in the middle of WordCamp Japan. That is a great opportunity to meet some contributors and maybe even get started with contributions yourself. So stop by if you haven&#8217;t had a chance to check it out already. I will leave a link in the show notes. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Let&#8217;s start with some highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Highlights</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Powerful Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Discover several new blocks and expressive tools, including blocks for&nbsp;<em>Page Lists</em>,&nbsp;<em>Site Title</em>,&nbsp;<em>Logo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tagline</em>. A powerful&nbsp;<em>Query Loop</em>&nbsp;block offers multiple ways for displaying lists of posts and comes with new block patterns that take advantage of its flexibility and creative possibilities.</li><li>Interacting with nested blocks has been made easier with a permanent toolbar button for selecting a parent. Block outlines are shown when hovering or focusing on the different block type buttons. Block handles are now also present for drag and drop when in “select” mode.</li><li>Introduces the&nbsp;<strong>List View</strong>, a panel that can be toggled and helps navigate complex blocks and patterns.</li><li>Reusable blocks have an improved creation flow and support for history revisions. </li><li>A cool new duotone block adds images effects which can be used in media blocks or supported in third-party blocks. Color presets can also be customized by the theme.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Handpicked Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Patterns can now also be recommended and selected during block setup, offering powerful new flows. Pattern transformations are also possible and allow converting a block or a collection of blocks into different patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New collection of Patterns and an initial integration with the upcoming Pattern Directory on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Better Tools</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><span style=\"color: initial;, sans-serif\">New template editor that allows creating new custom templates for a page using blocks.</span></li><li>Themes can now control and configure styling with a theme.json file, including layout configuration, block supports, color palettes, and more.</li><li>New design tools and enhancements to existing blocks, including more color, typography, and spacing options, drag and drop for Cover backgrounds, additions to block transformation options, ability to embed PDFs within the File block, and more.</li><li>Includes improvements to how the editor is rendered to more accurately resemble the frontend.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Internet Explorer 11</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Support for Internet Explorer 11 is ending in WordPress this year.

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone who has ever organized something, whether it&#8217;s a social event, a school project, or an annual family gathering, you know that there are many different opinions. The more opinions you have, the more likely people don&#8217;t see eye to eye. And before you know it, you&#8217;ve got some disagreements. Some things make disagreements worse, like imbalance of information, lack of showing your work, and sometimes just “too many cooks in the kitchen,” to use a regional phrase. Frankly, sometimes it seems like the second you have more than one cook in your kitchen, you&#8217;re going to get some disagreements. But I think that&#8217;s a healthy thing. WordPress is huge. And there are huge numbers of people contributing to WordPress or any other open source project you want to name. So there&#8217;s a lot of stuff available to disagree about. If we never saw anyone pointing out an area that wasn&#8217;t quite right, there would probably be something wrong. If you, like me, think that a healthy tension of collaborative disagreement can be useful when approached thoughtfully, then this quick start guide is for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step one, prepare to host a discussion. This is, by the way, just the hardest step out there. You have to take a little time to figure out what problem you&#8217;re solving with the solution you&#8217;re suggesting, any goals that it relates to, and then figure out what the bare minimum best outcome would be and what the wildest dreams magic wand waving outcome would be. And you have to be honest with yourself.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step two, host the discussion. The venue will be different for different discussions, but you see a lot of these on team blogs or within the actual tickets where work is being done. Wherever you&#8217;re hosting it, state the problem, state your idea for the solution and ask for what you missed. If you&#8217;re hosting a discussion in person, like in a town hall format, this can be hard. And generally, hosting discussions in an in-person or voice call or zoom call kind of way is hard. So if you have an opportunity to start doing this in text first and level your way up to in person, that&#8217;s my recommendation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Step three is to summarize the discussion and post a decision if possible. So organizing a big discussion into main points is a really good practice for the people you&#8217;re summarizing it for and yourself. It helps you to confirm your understanding, and it also gives you the chance to pair other solutions with the problem and goals you outlined in step one. If a different solution solves the same problem but with less time or effort, it&#8217;s worth taking a second look with less time or effort. There’s something that I say to WordPress contributors frequently, and that is there are a lot of yeses. There are a lot of right ways to do things and only a few clear wrong ways to do things. So be open-minded about whether or not someone else&#8217;s right way to do things could still achieve the goals you&#8217;re trying to accomplish with your solution. A note on step three where I said, “and post the decision if possible.” Sometimes you&#8217;re the person to make that decision, but sometimes you are not the person who can give something the green light, and so you&#8217;re preparing a recommendation. Whether you&#8217;re making a decision or a recommendation, sometimes you may experience a little decision-making paralysis. I know I do. So here are a few of the tools that I use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re avoiding the decision, use the 10/10/10 rule; it can help you figure out if you&#8217;re stuck on a short-term problem. If there are too many good choices, use the Eisenhower Matrix that can help you to prioritize objectively. If there are too many bad choices, use the Maximin strategy. It can help you to identify how to minimize any potential negative impacts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so you&#8217;ve considered your position. You’ve discussed everything. You summarized the big points. Maybe you also worked your way through to a recommendation or a decision. What about everyone who disagreed with the decision? Or have you made a recommendation, and it wasn&#8217;t accepted? How do you deal with that? That&#8217;s where “disagree and commit” shows up. This phrase was made popular by the folks over at Amazon, I think. But it first showed up, I believe at Sun Microsystems as this phrase, “agreeing, commit, disagree and commit or get out of the way.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:34</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disagree and commit as a concept works pretty well when everyone agrees on the vision and the goals, but not necessarily how to get to those goals. We&#8217;ve had moments in recent history where folks we&#8217;re not able to agree, we’re not able to commit, and so then left the project. I hate when that happens. I want people to thrive in this community for the entire length of their careers. But I also understand that situation shows up in the top five learnings of open source when you no longer have interest in the project and handed it off to a competent successor. So there it is &#8211; disagreements in open source in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with so many of the things I discuss on this podcast, this is incredibly complex and nuanced in practice. Taking an argument, distilling facts from feelings, and adjusting frames of reference until the solution is well informed and risk-balanced. That is a skill set unto itself. But one that increases the health of any organization. I’ll share that list of references and general materials in the show notes, including a link explaining each of those decision-making tools that I shared. I&#8217;m also going to include the contributor training module on decision-making in the WordPress project. It&#8217;s got excellent information. It&#8217;s part of a series of modules that I asked team reps to take and sponsored contributors. I don&#8217;t require it from anyone, but I do hope that it is useful for you. Also, speaking of useful for you, if you are just here for leadership insights, I included some hot takes after the outro music for you. It&#8217;s like an Easter egg, but I just told you about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us to our small list of big things! First off, WordCamp Europe is happening this we; I hope that everybody has an opportunity to attend. If you still haven&#8217;t gotten your tickets, they are free, and I think there are still a few left. I will include a link in the show notes as well. There&#8217;s going to be a little demo with Matt Mullenweg and Matias Ventura on the WordPress 5.8 release that&#8217;s coming up. And then kind of a retrospective discussion between Matt and Brian Krogsgard. I encourage you to join; I think it&#8217;s going to be very interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also WordCamp, Japan coming up June 20 through 26th. I mentioned it last time &#8211;&nbsp; it has a big section of contributing and contribution time. So if you&#8217;re looking to get started, some projects are laid out, and I encourage you to take a look at that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new thing on this list, and I don&#8217;t know how new It is, in general, I hope it&#8217;s not too new to you, is that WordPress 5.8 release is reaching its beta one milestone on June 8th, so right in the middle of WordCamp Europe. I encourage every single theme developer, plugin developer that we have, agency owners that we have to really take a look at this release and dig into testing it. It&#8217;s a gigantic release. And I have so many questions about what will work and will not work once we get it into a broader testing area. We&#8217;ve been doing a lot of testing in the outreach program. But it&#8217;s always helpful to get people who are using WordPress daily in their jobs to really give a good solid test to the beta product to the beta package. And put it all through its paces for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey there, you must be here because I told you about this totally not hidden easter egg about my hot takes on organizational health; I have three for you. And if you&#8217;ve ever worked with me, none of this will surprise you. But if you haven&#8217;t worked with me, hopefully, it kind of gives you some idea about how I approach all of this a bit differently. So, number one, critical feedback is the sign of a healthy organization. And I will never be dissuaded from that opinion. A complete lack of dissent doesn&#8217;t look like “alignment.” To me, that looks like fear. And it goes against the open source idea that many eyes make all bugs shallow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tip number two, a bit of tension is good, a bit of disagreement is good. The same thing that I say about women in tech, we&#8217;re not all the same. And if we were, then we wouldn&#8217;t need to collaborate anyway. But diversity, whether that&#8217;s the diversity of thought or of a person or of experience, just doesn&#8217;t happen without some misunderstandings. It&#8217;s how we choose to grow through those misunderstandings that make all the difference for the type of organization we are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And hot take number three, changing your mind isn&#8217;t flip-flopping or hypocritical. I think that&#8217;s a sign of growth and willingness to hear others. I like to think of my embarrassment at past bad decisions &#8211; as the sore muscles of a learning brain. And I, again, probably won&#8217;t be dissuaded from that opinion. Although, you know, if I&#8217;m sticking true to changing your mind some flip-flopping or hypocritical, maybe I will, but you can always try to, to give me the counter-argument for that, and we&#8217;ll see how it goes.

She first explored content creation and design before focusing on SEO and becoming an independent specialist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana was hired as a Customer Happiness Engineer for a hosting company, where she discovered the benefits of having a team. She realized that having close working relationships with colleagues is helpful for business success and accelerates personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana hopes that by sharing her story, she can help others who are either starting their career or are moving roles. She describes the opportunities she discovered in the WordPress community as ‘a huge epiphany’, especially in the world of freelancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights <strong>5 things that helped her to start a new freelancing career</strong>. Let’s dive into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What motivates me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Why am I doing this?” is the first question that Tijana asks herself before starting anything new. This self-review and honesty, she feels, allows her to determine her priorities. She also benchmarks options around her motivations of wanting a flexible schedule and to grow professionally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She lists the reasons to make a particular choice, like being a freelancer, to help her choose the right job, pathway, or identify alternatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recommends that others can take a similar approach. If freelancing is still the best solution after examining all their goals and motivations, Tijana believes a good next step would be to learn WordPress-related skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cdHeIL-H_mE6QFCUxUT-gfKS2GzizRHtn4iCENoaWOimC82BfModRJh44QbhvHPW0GNVP5eUPhgxQteDRbA_9EUzpssTXMGWje1hUuKyrfXUgGhCnvXQdraaUQiaGBjFr73dNYxr\" alt=\"WordCamp Europe 2019 group picture\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Develop WordPress related skills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question you may ask: “Why WordPress?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is used by more than 40% of websites in some form and offers various roles, many of which are not developer-specific. Tijana highlights a few:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>web developer (coding websites, themes, and plugins)</li><li>web implementor (creating websites from existing themes without coding)</li><li>web designer (designing website mock-ups, editing images, or creating online infographics)</li><li>client support professional (helping people with their websites)</li><li>website maintenance (WordPress, themes, and plugins are maintained and backed up regularly)</li><li>WordPress trainer (helping clients with how to use the platform or teaching other web professionals)</li><li>content writer</li><li>accessibility specialist (making sure standards are met and suggesting solutions for accessibility barriers)</li><li>SEO consultant (improving search outcomes and understanding)</li><li>statistics consultant, especially for web shops</li><li>WordPress assistant (adding new content and editing existing posts)</li><li>website migration specialist (moving websites from one server to another)</li><li>web security specialist</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/16XExYT_P4R4PX3orOaWbueDfkBIA6PFQ-CuYEXdeN9AvUIuIF33aIjT1DpdnFCqhrijWv1f68OR2Qh14xGT9REHGJ-MqK-OxJ9XcrhZ3IkcW8DBI7nVAtvFcCnCHL0woka_FV6t\" alt=\"WCBGD group picture\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasized: “Another reason why WordPress is great for freelancers is the strong community that exists around this content management system (CMS).&#8221; WordCamps and Meetups are a way to get useful information and meet people from a large and very diverse community and get answers to many questions straight away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year, these events have been primarily online. However, the contributors who run them continue to make an effort to provide an experience as close to in-person events as possible. The biggest advantage to online events is that we can attend events from across the world, even if sometimes during these difficult times, it is difficult to get enough time to deeply into this new experience. Since Tijana’s first Meetup, she has attended many WordPress community events and volunteered as a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plan in advance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a freelancer takes time. For Tijana, success came with proper planning and following her plan to ‘acquire or improve relevant skills that will make you stand out in the freelance market.’ She strongly believes that learning and growing as a professional opens more business opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering a freelance career, she advises improving relevant skills or developing new skills related to your hobbies as ‘there is nothing better than doing what you love.’ In cases where no previous experience and knowledge can be used, she suggests choosing ‘a job that has a shorter learning curve and builds your knowledge around that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana started as a content creator and learned to become an SEO expert. However, she highlights many alternative paths, including starting as a web implementer and moving to train as a developer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests to others: “It would be a good idea to analyze the market before you jump into the learning process.” She also recommends people check the latest trends and consider the future of the skills they are developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit the new <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress.org</a> to see what topics are of interest to you. In this newly established resource, the WordPress community aggregates workshops to support those who want to start and improve their skills, provides lesson plans for professional WordPress trainers and helps you create personal learning to develop key skills. There is also material on helping you be part of and organize events for your local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights that there are many places for freelancers to find clients. For example, the WordPress Community has a place where companies and individual site owners publish their job advertisements&nbsp; &#8211; <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">Jobs.WordPress.net</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hurray, it’s time to get a first freelancing job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a pragmatic person, Tijana recommends: “Save money before quitting your job to become a full-time freelancer. Alternatively, try freelancing for a few hours per week to see if you like it. Although some people do benefit when taking a risk, think twice before you take any irreversible actions.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She shared some possible next steps:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>use a freelancing platform</li><li>triple-check your resume</li><li>professionally present yourself</li><li>fill up your portfolio with examples</li><li>use video material</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“By using video material, your clients will not see you like a list of skills and previous experiences, but as a real person that has these skills and experiences and that provides a certain service for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “Have a detailed strategy when choosing your first employer. Choose your first employer wisely, very wisely. I can’t emphasize enough how important this is”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Tijana took her first freelancing job, she considered the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>how was the employer rated by other freelancers who worked for him previously</li><li>how does the employer rate other freelancers</li><li>how much money had they already spent on the platform</li><li>the number of open positions for a specific job and the number of freelancers that have already applied&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“The first job is not all about the money. Don’t get greedy on your first job. If you get good recommendations, your second job can pay two to three times more. And your third job can go up to five times more. That was my experience.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take responsibility as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana reminds us: “Freedom often comes with responsibility; individual responsibility is key when it comes to freelancing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She advises others not to take a job if you can not make a deadline and have someone reliable who can help you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing deadlines will cost your client money and affect the review the client will be willing to leave about your job, and this can have a big impact on your future opportunities or freelance jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “This can start a downward spiral for your career. However, we are all humans, and unpredictable things can happen. If for some reason you are not able to complete your work in a timely manner, let your client know immediately so they can have enough time to hire someone else”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasizes the importance of making expectations clear before accepting a job, both what the client is expecting and what you can expect from the client.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, she points out that if you are working from home, your friends and family should treat you the way they would if you were in an office. She advises: “Let them know about your working schedule.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She hopes that these basic guidelines will be useful in launching freelance careers, as they did her, even though there is no universal recipe for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights: “It’s just important to stay focused on your goals and to be open to new opportunities.” Freelancing wasn’t the only way she could have fulfilled her goals, but it was an important part of her path, and it helped her be confident in her abilities to make the next big step in her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, she was missing close relationships with colleagues and teamwork, which she has now found in her current firm. Her colleagues describe her as a: “walking-talking bundle of superpowers: sports medicine and fitness professional, SEO expert, blogger, designer and a kitty foster mum”.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PIGT9R6FmtEHsNBvWzyViW5htRAm156asTOsohOGOUwfsWjW1TuDhUI9yuZnjIe-1eFHfFUWPULPtw82P3YYXHa0bsY_jA5keelmDHfSkTdd3xUsVZTmG9KvdE8XTojvU3LxYCsi\" alt=\"Conference reception\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering starting your career as a freelancer, take the courses offered at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">learn.wordpress.org,</a> reach out to companies that you would be interested in working with, and remember that there are a whole host of opportunities in the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">The WordPress.org Teams</a> &#8211; what they do, when and where they meet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress resource</a> &#8211; free to use to expand your knowledge and skills of using the platform and learning about the community around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3-day <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Europe 2021</a> online event begins on 7 June 2021.

From the block toolbar, use the filter button and choose a preset:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/duotone_howto.mov\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also choose colors from your theme’s palette, or a custom color of your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to the image block, duotone can be applied to both images and video in the cover block.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/06/waves-a60072-67ff66.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Will This Overwrite Images in My Media Library?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Images and videos in your media library will remain unchanged. The duotone effect works using <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG11/filters.html\">SVG filters</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/filter-effects-1/\">CSS filter property</a>, so the image or video is never modified in your library. On the one hand, this means that you can apply a filter to an image that you link to that doesn’t exist in your media library. On the other hand, this means that the filter won’t show up in RSS feeds or places that use the image URL directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can I Add Duotone Colors to Blocks or Themes That I Develop?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The API for adding duotone colors to blocks is experimental in Gutenberg v10.6. Still, the documentation for using it in your own blocks can be found and will be updated under <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/#color\">Supports Color</a> in the Block Editor Handbook. Themes can add duotone presets with theme.json. More information can be found under <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/#presets\">Global Settings &amp; Styles Presets</a> in the Block Editor Handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Try it Out Now Using the Gutenberg plugin</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The duotone feature was released in version 10.6 of the Gutenberg plugin, so you can try it out now prior to the WordPress 5.8 release in July.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Thanks to <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joen/\">@joen</a> and <em><em><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mkaz/\">@mkaz</a></em></em></em> <em>for assistance writing and reviewing this post.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10349\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:52:\"WP Briefing: Episode 9: The Cartography of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/episode-9-the-cartography-of-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 24 May 2021 11:55:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"wp-briefing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=10373\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:159:\"In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy provides a map of how to navigate WordPress teams and communication channels, along with her small list of big things.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:9:\"enclosure\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:3:\"url\";s:62:\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2021/05/WP-Briefining-009.mp3\";s:6:\"length\";s:1:\"0\";s:4:\"type\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12611:\"\n<p>In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy provides a map of how to navigate WordPress teams and communication channels, along with her small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

I&#8217;m your host, Joseph Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost every episode of this podcast, you can hear me invite you to join in the WordPress project, to contribute back, to get involved. And I&#8217;m sure that every time I say that there&#8217;s at least one of you who&#8217;s like “Yes. Challenge accepted!” And you wade in sight unseen, to immerse yourselves in the cheerful cacophony of open source at scale that is WordPress. You see before you all 158 ways you can start contributing and you are exhilarated by this lostness. This you think, is the lostness of infinite possibility. And for you, I&#8217;m really thankful. My work here today would not be possible if it weren&#8217;t for the brave souls who leap into something with hope as their primary plan and tactic. You are heroes, and I thank you very much for your service. For everyone else, I&#8217;m going to give you a quick tour of where WordPress collaborates and a little bit of how they collaborate. We&#8217;ll cover the Make network, the Making WordPress Slack, events for WordPress, and a rundown of the teams.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the Make network. The Make network of sites can be found at make.wordpress.org. That page includes information on most of our teams. Teams like Core and Design and Community. All of those teams require some technical skills since we&#8217;re a project built around a piece of software. However, some require a little more than others. You can think of this set of sites as the desk of each team in the WordPress project. It&#8217;s where they update each other, where they host discussions, where they refine proposals, and where they coordinate admin tasks. Contributors can write posts on most sites in the network as long as they follow the guidelines and best practices. And anyone with a wordpress.org profile can join in discussions in the comments. Most work on the Make network is asynchronous, and discussions stay open for a long enough time to allow anyone in the world to weigh in when they have the time. It&#8217;s how we try to remember that we are a globally-minded project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second area is the Making WordPress Slack instance. The Making WordPress Slack instance can be found at wordpress.slack.com, and it requires an account that is associated with your wordpress.org profile. Each team in the project has a channel, although not all channels in that Slack instance, represent a standalone team. You can think of this Slack instance as a set of conference rooms. It&#8217;s where contributors connect, gain a more nuanced understanding of problems that we&#8217;re trying to solve. They host synchronous meetings and also coordinate working groups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors can post in most channels, although there are a few that are restricted. We don&#8217;t have any social channels in this Slack instance, but most WordPress-ers do tend to find friends that they connect with. The work done here is synchronous, and most meetings last about an hour. There are about 35+ meetings a week, so you can basically always find someone around.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last area we work is actually at WordPress events. Word Camps and WordPress meetups happen all over the world. Unless there&#8217;s a global pandemic, then they&#8217;re kind of all over the computer and at all times of day and night. You can keep track of those on wordcamp.org or on WordPress’s meetup page, which I&#8217;ve linked in the notes below. These events bring together all sorts of facets of the WordPress project. And they are an event where local WordPress communities aim to connect, inspire and educate each other. There&#8217;s always someone at these events, who knows a little bit more about WordPress than you do. If you&#8217;re headed to want to learn more about contribution, look out for any that have a contributor day or are hosting a contribution drive. These are clearly synchronous events. And when we do get back to doing them in person, they&#8217;re also tied to physical locations. When we get back to them, I encourage you to find one that&#8217;s close to you. They are incredibly valuable.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so that&#8217;s the map of the area. Those are the three big places where we get this stuff done. Let&#8217;s do a quick map of the teams themselves. If you&#8217;re a developer and you&#8217;re looking to work inside the technology space, work with code a bit, then your best chances for teams are Core and all of its related components. They&#8217;re like 50 components, including core editor and various other things. There&#8217;s also the Mobile team WP CLI, the Tide team, Security, our brand new team, Openverse, and Meta. Those all take a fairly high amount of code knowledge to contribute there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re more into design and product work, then we have a few teams for that as well. There&#8217;s of course, the Design team, but we also have Accessibility, Test, Triage, Polyglots kind of falls in there for me. But if you are a programs person, and we&#8217;re talking like programs, getting people together programs, not programs, as in programming or code. So if you&#8217;re a programs person, you&#8217;re looking more at the Community team, at the Themes team, the Plugin team, Polyglots, again, Training support, probably a number of others that have like program components in it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are really interested in learning more about contributor experience, which is how we build tools, and again, programs for all of the contributors who are showing up, then the teams for you will be teams like Meta and Documentation, Hosting, the Community team, the Training team, arguably any team that has a program as part of it is considered contributor experience because that&#8217;s how we help our contributors know what to do, what not to do, how to help them get onboarded, find their way, stuff like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re more in the communications area of things, we have quite a few teams there as well. We do have Marketing, of course, but also I think that Support ends up in our communications area, WordPress TV, obviously ends up in communications. But I think Training, Meta, Documentation, and arguably, maybe also Testing ends up in that space as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I realize that there are a handful of teams that I mentioned multiple times, especially Polyglots, Support, Test, Triage, Meta, Community. The reason they end up in a number of different places is that all of those teams also have a fair amount of admin and infrastructure stuff that goes into the WordPress project and community as a whole. So it touches a lot of other teams, and so they get a lot of mentions. All right. So WordPress adventurers, you now have a beginner&#8217;s map. I hope it helps, and I hope we see you around the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re still with me, that brings us today to my small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got four things for you, and I&#8217;m excited about all of them. The first two are events actually. WordCamp Europe is coming up from June seventh through the ninth. It will include a presentation from the WordPress project co-founder, Matt Mullenweg, so I encourage you to hop over, grab a ticket to check out the rest of the sessions that are happening while you&#8217;re there. The next one is WordCamp, Japan, which is happening June 20th through the 26th. And you heard that right that is seven whole days of WordCamp. It&#8217;s a little bit of a different format than we normally take, but it&#8217;s five days actually of contribution on ten specific projects. Then that&#8217;s bookended on either side of those contribution days, with full days of sessions. There&#8217;s some in English, but it&#8217;s primarily in Japanese. But either way, I think it&#8217;s going to be a really excellent event, and I encourage everyone to check it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of my list is not events. We have opened our sixth call for testing, it&#8217;s specifically looking at the template editing mode for Full Site Editing. It is an iteration on one of our earliest tests for the Full Site Editing outreach program. And so it has incorporated a lot of the feedback that we got in that test the first time around. So if you look at that test, which by the way, are all guided, if you&#8217;ve never tested anything before, don&#8217;t let this scare you. It&#8217;s really well written, it&#8217;s got a good guide on it and, and also allows for a little bit of exploration. But if you participated in the landing page test that we did early on, this is the follow-up to that. It incorporates a lot of the feedback that we got, so this is closing that feedback loop and I encourage you to stop by and participate in that test. It will be linked in the show notes and also I tweet about it a bit so you can run over there and find it also.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;WordPress is dropping support for Internet Explorer 11. That&#8217;s happening over the summer, so around the middle of July is when that&#8217;s going to happen. If you&#8217;ve been using WordPress for a while you&#8217;ve been getting notifications. If you happen to get to WordPress with IE11, letting you know that that this particular browser is reaching the end of its life for support in general on the web, but now WordPress also is making the choice to drop support for that. And so there&#8217;s a post out on wordpress.org/news, which I will also link to in the show notes in case you have not heard about this yet. It shouldn&#8217;t have any immediate and noticeable effects on anyone who&#8217;s visiting a site that&#8217;s built using WordPress. There might be a few things in the dashboard that don&#8217;t work if you are administering a WordPress site from IE11. So there&#8217;s a lot of good information in that post. Give it a read and if you have questions, always feel free to stop by the Core chat and ask those as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks!</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"10373\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 02:23:23 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 22:18:35 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20201016172007\";}','no'),(205,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_9bbd59226dc36b9b26cd43f15694c5c3','1626877403','no'),(206,'_transient_feed_mod_9bbd59226dc36b9b26cd43f15694c5c3','1626834203','no'),(207,'_transient_timeout_feed_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1626877404','no'),(208,'_transient_feed_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','a:4:{s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:3:\"rss\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"version\";s:3:\"2.0\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:7:\"channel\";a:1:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"WordPress Planet\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"http://planet.wordpress.org/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"language\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2:\"en\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"WordPress Planet - http://planet.wordpress.org/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"item\";a:50:{i:0;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:112:\"WPTavern: WordPress 5.8 “Tatum” Introduces Block Widgets, Duotone Media Filters, New Emoji Support, and More\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=120192\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:251:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-tatum-introduces-block-widgets-duotone-media-filters-new-emoji-support-and-more?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-5-8-tatum-introduces-block-widgets-duotone-media-filters-new-emoji-support-and-more\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7541:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WordPress 5.8 &ldquo;Tatum,&rdquo; named in honor of jazz pianist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Tatum\">Art Tatum</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/tatum/\">landed earlier today</a>. It is the second major release in 2021. It includes duotone media filters, block-based widgets, theme-related blocks, template editing, and theme JSON file support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release also ships tons of other notable features, such as <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-adds-support-for-new-emoji-introduced-in-twemoji-13-1-0\">support for new Emoji</a> and an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/no-more-accidental-custom-plugin-overrides-wordpress-5-8-to-allow-developers-to-set-plugin-hostname\">Update URI field</a> for plugin authors to offer custom updates. The latest update also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-to-drop-support-for-ie11-in-upcoming-5-8-or-5-9-release\">drops support for IE11</a>, saying goodbye to the era of Internet Explorer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg led the WordPress 5.8 release, which saw contributions from 530 volunteers. The entire release team closed 320 Trac tickets and over 1,500 GitHub pull requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official release squad members were:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Release Co-Coordinator: Jeffrey Paul</li><li>Release Co-Coordinator: Jonathan Desrosiers</li><li>Editor Tech Lead: Riad Benguella</li><li>Marketing and Communications Lead: Josepha Haden Chomphosy</li><li>Documentation Lead: Milana Cap</li><li>Test Lead: Piotrek Boniu</li><li>Support Lead: Mary Job</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Duotone and Media Improvements</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Duotone filter + gradient overlay on a Cover block.<br />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Image and Cover blocks received a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/duotone-filters-wordpress-5-8-puts-a-powerful-image-editing-tool-into-users-hands\">new duotone feature</a>. It is a filter that allows users to lay two colors over their media, creating unique effects. The colors overwrite the shadows and highlights of the image or video. Users can use WordPress&rsquo;s defaults, theme-defined colors, or create their own mixes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 also introduces several <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-media-library-changes-you-should-know-about\">upgrades to the media library</a>. The development team replaced infinite scrolling with a &ldquo;load more&rdquo; button, improving the experience for screen-reader and keyboard users. End-users can now copy media file URLs from the Add New media screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest release offers <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-introduces-support-for-webp-images\">WebP image format</a> support for the first time, and developers have a new <code>image_editor_output_format</code> filter hook to fine-tune the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Widgets</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Widgets screen with a Gallery block in the Footer sidebar.<br />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For the first time since the block system launched with WordPress 5.0 nearly three years ago, blocks are no longer confined to the post content editor. Users can now use them <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\">in any available sidebar</a>. This is a stepping stone in the Full Site Editing experience that will eventually lead to block themes and the site editor. In the meantime, it is a way for users to begin trying out blocks in new ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, those experiences may vary, depending on the active theme. Some older projects may not hold up well with this system. Authors may need to opt-out of the feature. Users who do not want to use block widgets or run into trouble can install the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classic-widgets-plugin-disables-wordpress-5-8s-upcoming-block-based-widgets-system\">Classic Widgets plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Query Loop and Theme Blocks</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop pattern inserter: carousel view.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The power to create lists, grids, and other designs around a group of posts has long been solely in the wheelhouse of developers. Users had to rely on their themes or specialized plugins to make such changes. This is no longer the case. Users will have the power to create almost any type of post list they want from now and far into the future with the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/query-loop-the-ins-and-outs-of-one-of-wordpress-5-8s-most-powerful-features\">Query Loop block</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, this is just the beginning. WordPress 5.8&rsquo;s new block is merely an introduction to what will eventually be one of the foundational elements to Full Site Editing in the coming years. As more and more blocks continue to mature, users and theme authors will continue building all sorts of layouts from this simple starting point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Query Loop block will also be the first introduction of the pattern inserter to many users. This is a new tool that allows users to scroll through block patterns, choose one, and customize. In the future, it will become a more prominent feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inserting lists of posts is just scratching the surface. WordPress 5.8 ships a new &ldquo;Theme&rdquo; category of blocks for users to play around with. Many of these are primarily for use within the Query Loop, such as the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-beta-1-released-new-blocks-new-widgets-screen-and-pattern-directory-on-deck\">Post* blocks</a>. However, others like Site Title and Site Tagline will be handy in the template editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Template Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a custom landing page template.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">template editor</a> provides users with a method of creating reusable templates. And, they do not need a 100% block theme to do it. The feature opens an overlay from the content-editing screen for users to customize their page header, footer, and everything in between.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is essentially a scaled-back version of the upcoming site editor. With 5.8, its primary use case will be for creating custom landing pages. It is a lot of power in the hands of the average user. And, it helps WordPress inch closer to its goal of not only democratizing publishing but also design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The downside to this feature?</em> It is currently opt-in. The active theme must declare support for users to access it. Many will not see it until developers submit updates.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developers: theme.json Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Real-world theme.json file.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WordPress 5.8 lets theme authors begin tapping into global styles and settings configuration via the new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-8-a-developer-centric-call-for-testing-theme-json-configuration\"><code>theme.json</code> system</a>. In the coming years, this will be the foundation of how themers build their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, the new file is a bridge between themes, WordPress, and users, a standardized method of communication that puts them all on the same page. Theme authors define which settings it supports and its default styles. WordPress reflects these via the editing interfaces and on the front end. And, users can overwrite them on a per-block basis or, eventually, through the Global Styles feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, it is an opt-in feature that both traditional and block themes can utilize. Themers will want to start moving their projects over to using it now that WordPress 5.8 is on the doorstep.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 19:56:02 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 5.8 Tatum\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10976\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/tatum/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48364:\"<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"422\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/5x8-Album-1.jpg?resize=632%2C422&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11042\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing 5.8 “Tatum”, our latest and greatest release now available for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/\">download</a>&nbsp;or update in your dashboard. Named in honor of Art Tatum, the legendary Jazz pianist. His formidable technique and willingness to push boundaries inspired musicians and changed what people thought could be done.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So fire up your music service of choice and enjoy Tatum’s famous recordings of ‘Tea for Two’, ‘Tiger Rag’, ‘Begin the Beguine’, and ‘Night and Day’ as you read about what the latest WordPress version brings to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Three Essential Powerhouses</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"474\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-widgets-blocks.png?resize=632%2C474&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10985\" /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"501\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-query-loop.png?resize=632%2C501&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10986\" /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"411\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-template.png?resize=632%2C411&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10987\" /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Manage Widgets with Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of hard work, the power of blocks has come to both the Block Widgets Editor and the Customizer. Now you can add blocks both in widget areas across your site and with live preview through the Customizer. This opens up new possibilities to create content: from no-code mini layouts to the vast library of core and third-party blocks. For our developers, you can find more details in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/block-based-widgets-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\">Widgets dev note</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Display Posts with New Blocks and Patterns</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Query Loop Block makes it possible to display posts based on specified parameters; like a PHP loop without the code. Easily display posts from a specific category, to do things like create a portfolio or a page full of your favorite recipes. Think of it as a more complex and powerful Latest Posts Block! Plus, pattern suggestions make it easier than ever to create a list of posts with the design you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Edit the Templates Around Posts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use the familiar block editor to edit templates that hold your content—simply activate a block theme or a theme that has opted in for this feature. Switch from editing your posts to editing your pages and back again, all while using a familiar block editor. There are more than 20 new blocks available within compatible themes. Read more about this feature and how to experiment with it in the release notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">Three Workflow Helpers</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"496\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-list-view.png?resize=632%2C496&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10988\" /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"343\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-pattern-suggestions.png?resize=632%2C343&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10989\" /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img width=\"632\" height=\"517\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-duotone.png?resize=632%2C517&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10990\" /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3>Overview of the Page Structure</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes you need a simple landing page, but sometimes you need something a little more robust. As blocks increase, patterns emerge, and content creation gets easier, new solutions are needed to make complex content easy to navigate. List View is the best way to jump between layers of content and nested blocks. Since the List View gives you an overview of all the blocks in your content, you can now navigate quickly to the precise block you need. Ready to focus completely on your content? Toggle it on or off to suit your workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Suggested Patterns for Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Starting in this release the Pattern Transformations tool will suggest block patterns based on the block you are using. Right now, you can give it a try in the Query Block and Social Icon Block. As more patterns are added, you will be able to get inspiration for how to style your site without ever leaving the editor!</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Style and Colorize Images</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Colorize your image and cover blocks with duotone filters! Duotone can add a pop of color to your designs and style your images (or videos in the cover block) to integrate well with your themes. You can think of the duotone effect as a black and white filter, but instead of the shadows being black and the highlights being white, you pick your own colors for the shadows and highlights. There’s more to learn about how it works in the documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-text-align-center\">For Developers to Explore</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"378\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/07/about-theme-json-2x.png?resize=632%2C378&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10992\" />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Theme.json</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Introducing the Global Styles and Global Settings APIs: control the editor settings, available customization tools, and style blocks using a theme.json file in the active theme.

to all of the community volunteers who contribute in the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a>. They answer questions from people across the world, whether they are using WordPress for the first time, or they’ve been around since the first release all the way back in 2003. These releases are as successful as they are because of their efforts!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, thanks to all the community translators who help make WordPress available in over 200 languages for every release. 80 languages have translated 80% or more WordPress 5.8 and our community translators are hard at work ensuring more languages are on their way.

Founders Katya Bazilevskaya, Alexey Ametov, Vasily Esmanov, Roman Khudonogov, and the rest of the Setka team will join Tiny as part of the agreement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiny has been tracking an increasing developer demand for rich text editing components, citing 8.1 million TinyMCE downloads (up 77%) and 106 million  downloads of rich text editing components in general from NPM in the last 12 months (up 53% YoY).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;TinyMCE has typically focused on the average business user or knowledge worker; someone familiar with Microsoft Word or Google Docs,&rdquo; Tiny founder and CEO Andrew Roberts said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;With Setka, we can now serve professional content creators and designers who want more advanced options.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>TinyMCE is used by millions of WordPress users, most visibly in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor</a> plugin as well as the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/\">Advanced Editor Tools</a> plugin, previously known as TinyMCE Advanced. Advanced Editor Tools adds a &ldquo;Classic Paragraph&rdquo; block to the block editor that gives access to the TinyMCE editor with configurable rows and buttons. It provides a stepping stone for those who are not quite ready to switch to the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While Tiny is a widely recognized leader in rich text editing, <a href=\"https://setka.io/\">Setka</a> allows for more interactive content creation with design capabilities for arranging text, images, and other visual elements. It allows users to create and save post templates and easily reuse design elements throughout the WYSIWYG design process. Tiny plans to merge TinyMCE and Setka for a combined platform that will offer more than either product alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Modern day content creators are much more ambitious, and Setka allows us to meet more demanding use cases,&rdquo; Roberts said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Over time, we envisage a combined editor platform that is both easy to use and powerful.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Setka currently offers integrations for several CMS&rsquo;s, document management tools, and CRMs, including WordPress, Drupal, Magento, Ghost, Microsoft Sharepoint, and Hubspot. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/setka-editor/\">Setka WordPress plugin</a> integrates with the block editor and provides its own content block that can work together with other blocks on the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Former CEO Kate Bazilevskaya, who will be assuming the role of director of business development and partnerships at Tiny, said the team intends to focus on the CMS space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Through an array of integrations, we hope to make this visual building technology more accessible to businesses who already have a CMS in place, yet want more power in their editing tools,&rdquo; Bazilevskaya said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 04:39:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 9.0.0 “Mico”\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=320072\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://buddypress.org/2021/07/buddypress-9-0-0-mico/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7905:\"<p>9.0.0 is named after Mico&#8217;s Pizza in <a href=\"https://goo.gl/maps/1i8B9yEQE277bKPo7\">Sanary</a>, a little town on the french riviera.

With BuddyPress 9.0.0, we have introduced 10 new BuddyPress Blocks, so you can continue to use your favorite BP Widgets with the new WP Block approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new BP Widget Blocks are simply Legacy Widgets we’ve rebuilt as BP Blocks, which means you can also access them in the Block Editor for use in your posts or pages!</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2021/07/bp-widget-blocks-1.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"689\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2021/07/bp-widget-blocks-1-1024x689.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration showing BP Blocks collection.\" class=\"wp-image-320074\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><em>PS: Have you noticed that the icons for BuddyPress Blocks are now bright red?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3>Convert a Legacy Widget into a Block Widget in two clicks <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f60e.png\" alt=\"😎\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></h3>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2021/07/legacy-widget-to-block.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"530\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2021/07/legacy-widget-to-block-1024x530.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration showing the Legacy Widget to Widget Block transformation.\" class=\"wp-image-320075\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<p>As shown in the image above, it’s very easy to transform a Widget into a Block.

We’re also introducing a new Sitewide Notices endpoint to allow site admins to create, edit, or delete notices and let all of your users fetch the active notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><span class=\"dashicons dashicons-admin-generic\"></span></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Under the hood</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>9.0.0 comes with fewer changes than most of our releases but includes fixes for issues which appeared in 8.0.0 and BP Nouveau Template Pack improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<div><span class=\"dashicons dashicons-buddicons-buddypress-logo\"></span></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Many thanks to the 24 contributors who helped us build &amp; translate BuddyPress 9.0.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/boonebgorges/\">Boone B Gorges (boonebgorges)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sbrajesh/\">Brajesh Singh (sbrajesh)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dcavins/\">David Cavins (dcavins)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/dancaragea/\">Dan Caragea (dancaragea)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ianbarnes/\">Ian Barnes (ianbarnes)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nobnob/\">Javier Esteban (nobnob)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/johnjamesjacoby/\">John James Jacoby (johnjamesjacoby)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/leahkoerper/\">leahkoerper</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marbaque/\">marbaque</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/markscottrobson/\">Mark Robson (markscottrobson)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/imath/\">Mathieu Viet (imath)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/modemlooper/\">modemlooper</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/niftythree/\">Nifty (niftythree)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/DJPaul/\">Paul Gibbs (DJPaul)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/nekojonez/\">Pieterjan Deneys (nekojonez)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/r-a-y/\">r-a-y</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/espellcaste/\">Renato Alves (espellcaste)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shanebp\">shanebp</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/shawfactor/\">shawfactor</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/slaffik/\">Slava Abakumov (slaffik)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/netweb/\">Stephen Edgar (netweb)</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/tamarazambrana/\">tamarazambrana</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/tkserver\">TKServer</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/vapvarun/\">Varun Dubey (vapvarun)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Your feedback</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How are you using BuddyPress?

The plugin does a simple job of creating a single user role that can only moderate comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most common use case for such a role &mdash; named &ldquo;WPB Comment Moderator&rdquo; in the admin &mdash; is for larger teams that need a separate user account to tackle moderation. WordPress has no built-in way of handling this. For one of the most extendable CMSs on the planet, this is one area where it has always fallen short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It almost feels like yesterday. In reality, it was <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12104#comment:17\">10 years ago</a> when I stumbled upon a (then) year-old <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12104\">ticket for a bug</a> that was a breaking point in a project I was working on. I needed to grant specific users on a WordPress site permission to moderate comments but not allow them to edit other things in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of you may be thinking that the <code><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/article/roles-and-capabilities/#moderate_comments\">moderate_comments</a></code> capability should allow that. And, you would be correct in thinking that it <em><strong>should</strong></em>. However, that is not how it works at all. For users to edit comments, they must also be able to edit posts. It is a bit of a convoluted mess if you do a deep dive into the core code only to find hard-coded permissions checks that are impossible to override without rewriting large chunks of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would run into the same issue multiple times in the years since. I have built a few hacky, one-off workarounds for specific projects, but they were never ideal. And, I was never interested in maintaining a plugin that solved this problem because I knew it had the potential to be a bit of a pain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I have seen a few other solutions, each fundamentally flawed, I am happy to see someone tackling this without exposing permissions issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPBeginner&rsquo;s Comment Moderation Role plugin works in the same way that I think such a plugin should work, at least with the roadblocks that WordPress currently puts in the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Site administrators can add WPB Comment Moderator to any account via the user management admin screen. The process is the same as adding or removing any other role in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Granting the WPB Comment Moderator role to a user.\n\n\n\n<p>After adding the role to a user, that user can access the Comments admin screen. They can also see both the Dashboard and their own Profile in the admin. Except in the cases where they have another role added via a different plugin, they will not have permission to access other screens.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Comments admin screen for user with the WPB Comment Moderator role\n\n\n\n<p>Because of core WordPress&rsquo;s hard-coded permissions check, the plugin must create its own comments management screen. Most users will not notice this because it is all under the hood. The plugin only adds it when necessary, and it does not look or function any differently than the default screen. It is just a lot of code work and duplication to fix an 11-year-old reported bug in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until the foundational issue is addressed in core WordPress, Comment Moderation Role is the best plugin for this job. After extensive testing, I can now say that it is now nestled firmly in my toolbox, ready to pull out when needed for a project.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 22:13:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"Gutenberg Times: List of WordPress Themes for Full-Site Editing and Resources\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18502\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/list-of-wordpress-themes-for-full-site-editing-and-resources/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7700:\"<p>A few people ask about WordPress Themes that are already working with the Full-Site Editing system and the new Site Editor.

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And before we get started, I have to be honest with you all, this episode and the next one have made me feel really anxious. This one is about Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in open source, and especially in WordPress. And the next one is about accessibility in WordPress. And I feel like there&#8217;s just so much to do, and we don&#8217;t do enough, but we do what we can. And still, we will never be done with that work. And if you don&#8217;t know what I mean by Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, you can kind of think of it this way. Diversity is bringing in people with different viewpoints and lived experiences. Equity is making sure everyone has what they need to get a fair chance of success, which is different from equality. And Inclusion is making sure that the environment is built to not only tolerate diverse groups but to celebrate them as well. So remember this as you listen to what I have to say here. We are never where we want to be in either of those spaces. But that shouldn&#8217;t stop us from looking at the things we have done to get us in the right direction. All right. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I say a lot that we are a project that serves a majority collection of minority voices. WordPress is global in reach and open source in nature. And you would assume that what allows the software to be used by anyone would also enable it to be built by anyone. After all, your location doesn&#8217;t matter, and who employs you also doesn&#8217;t matter. And your relative social standing certainly shouldn&#8217;t matter. As long as you can communicate with the others contributing to the project, there should be no obstacle to your participation. The mission of the WordPress project is to democratize publishing, right? It&#8217;s to get the ability to have a website tap into passive income on your web presence. I mean, the job is to level the playing field for everyone. However, it&#8217;s my experience that bringing in new voices takes a lot of proactive work on behalf of leaders and contributors. It&#8217;s not enough to say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;m having a party,&#8221; you also have to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having a party, and I&#8217;d like you to be there.&#8221; It&#8217;s not enough to think people will make their own space at this table. You have to make sure that you have table settings for everyone. And even beyond the basics of directing people to you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on toward the next steps, you have to be honest about the fact that open source contribution requires a fair amount of privilege. By privilege, I mean the luxury of extra time or extra funding or just an understanding employer. WordPress supports 41% of the web. I think it&#8217;s 42% of the web right now. But less than 1% of people who use WordPress show up to help maintain it. And that 1% that does show up skews toward people who already have a pretty high level of representation and technology. And so, when you look at who is building it versus who is using it, it doesn&#8217;t always match. And since what we build so frequently reflects who we are, sometimes what we build doesn&#8217;t match the needs of the people who are using what we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what has WordPress done to be proactive on the question of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? There are quite a few unseen things that have gone into this over the years and a few pretty visible things. This is a very long list. And it has a whole lot of just reference material. And so the show notes today will come in handy for people, and there will be just a laundry list of linked resources for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first thing that WordPress has done is that we have accepted the burden of proof. I&#8217;m going to share a post about this in the show notes. That means we accept that it&#8217;s not the job of underrepresented folks to figure out if they are welcome. It&#8217;s up to us to make it clear that they are. So, there are three big little things that the community has done over the years. One is that many teams open their text-based meetings with an explanation of what is done in the meeting, who comes to the meetings, where to find help if you&#8217;re lost in the meeting, and for teams that have a specific type of requests that comes into those channels that aren&#8217;t handled in those channels. They also will share where people can go to get those requests taken care of. Many teams have also updated their team handbooks to have good beginner docs, limited use of inside jokes or jargon, and good first bugs. And also, there is a code of conduct in the community declaring that everyone is welcome and clarifies what to do if you see folks being unwelcoming.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:51</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A second big thing that folks in the WordPress community have done is written down what was unwritten. Having things clearly documented unlocks institutional knowledge that you&#8217;d otherwise have to know someone to get. Clarity and process and the structure help anyone engage with your organization, not just the people who have extra time to figure things out. What that looks like in the WordPress project is that many teams have documented their workflows and their working spaces and just their general team norms. Many teams have also started defining what it means to be a team rep and holding open processes to choose those team reps. Many other community leaders and I have written down countless unspoken rules, guidelines, and philosophical underpinnings so that people don&#8217;t have to guess what we&#8217;re doing or why we&#8217;re doing things, or where we want to do them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:46</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the more visible thing that the WordPress project has been doing is that we found ways to invite people in, and they&#8217;re not failsafe; they’re not foolproof, but it is certainly a step in the right direction. The first one is an ongoing, diverse speaker training initiative. And I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes as well. It is run by Jill Binder and a fantastic group of contributors that collaborate with her. And I really have loved watching that particular program grow and flourish and help WordPress make a difference where we absolutely can.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that was pretty visible about how we invited people in was at the end of 2020, and we had an all-women and nonbinary release squad for our biggest release of the year; WordPress 5.6. I had a group of probably 70 women and nonbinary identifying folx who joined in the process and joined in learning more about the process. Some of them have continued in the project. Others have stepped away for various reasons. But all of them are welcome to return. And I encourage everyone to return to contribution when time and resources make that possible for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:09</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing that we&#8217;ve done, which I have talked about a lot, is the revival of the testing and triage practices. That has been work that&#8217;s been ongoing for a number of years. And it happens across multiple teams. It is not always immediately clear to people why the testing work. And the triage work is identifiable for me as a way to invite people into this process. And so I&#8217;ll be briefly clear about it right now. So testing as a practice brings in the users that otherwise don&#8217;t have a lot of spare time and that extra privilege to like, figure out what&#8217;s going on with WordPress, and contribute their own fixes to problems. They can give back to this project by being co-developers with us, co-creators with our entire process of making WordPress real and usable for the largest number of people that we can because we now support 42% of the web. And then, the triage practice invites in a diverse voice of people. Because you don&#8217;t necessarily always need to know everything about a project to help with triage. And when you&#8217;re helping with triage, you get active learning through participating in the process. But you also get passive learning from the people who already know huge amounts about the project and the process and everything that goes into it. And so it&#8217;s a low key low stress way to get your feet wet and start building that knowledge that sometimes is hard to come by unless you are actively working in it. So the testing practices, the triage practices, I really to the core of my being believe that those are active and ongoing ways for us to invite people who otherwise wouldn&#8217;t have a chance to get their voices heard in an open source project. And y&#8217;all, as I said at the start, y’all, there&#8217;s nothing about this list that I just shared, which makes me feel like our work on this is done. Just like any muscle, you don&#8217;t fight to peak fitness, and then hit the big stop button on time and say, &#8220;Now, I never have to work out again.&#8221; If we did, the world would be a very different place probably. But it does then lead us to the next steps for fostering a community culture that&#8217;s as broad as the people who use this software. If you believe in leadership at any level, as I do, there are a ton of things that you can do right now. But I&#8217;ll boil them down into three big chunks of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, check your community area, or whatever community you want to apply this to, for things that need a little more proactive work. I will share a post called<em> Building A Culture of Safety</em> that will take you through a list of good first steps. And it is not as hard as it looks. When you say build a culture of safety, there are many really clear-cut minor changes that you can ask people to make and, in like, four or five different areas that can help your community be more welcoming and more open.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing that you can do is know that small changes add up over time and commit to making those changes where you can. If you are elite at any level, you know that supporting people and processes is the responsibility of everyone in the group. And if you can make your own autonomous decisions and commit to making small changes that make a big difference over time, you will be part of that solution. And that is not specific to any one group that we have in our communities. You can be an ally for anyone, whether they look like you, whether they have your same experiences, or not. And sometimes, it&#8217;s as easy as just holding space for the people who haven&#8217;t had a chance to talk yet. And on the subject of holding space and the way that we communicate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing that I think is incredibly important is that you can take on as a foundational personal practice the concept of ethical communication. I&#8217;ll share a post about that as well in the show notes, but the core of it is that you have to know that what you say and don&#8217;t say what you do and don&#8217;t do has an impact on others and embrace that responsibility. All right, so you made it all the way through, and I am so proud of you. I&#8217;m sure you have questions about this. And I encourage you to share those. You can email them to me at wp briefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:10</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to our small list of big things. I&#8217;ve got two things for you today. First and foremost, WordPress 5.8 gets released tomorrow. It&#8217;s a big release, and lots of people have been working on it. So get your update processes ready and keep an eye on wordpress.org/news for the announcement post. Second, and still pretty important, team reps have been working on their quarterly check-ins so that all other teams can get an idea of what&#8217;s happening around the WordPress office. Keep an eye out for that post on make.wordpress.org/updates. And that is your smallest of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host Joseph Hayden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"Gutenberg Times: Theme creation, Block plugin development and the Future of WordPress — Weekend Edition #178\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18531\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:114:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/theme-creation-block-plugin-development-and-the-future-of-wordpress-weekend-edition-17/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12172:\"<p>Howdy, my friends! </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 will be release next week.

Wayfinder outlines each block in the editor on hover. It then displays the block name at the upper left of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite feature that you will not find elsewhere is the addition of each block&rsquo;s classes at the bottom right of the box. This makes it easy for designers or users who want to quickly find a class for styling.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Outline of a Heading block.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can also enable or disable the pieces of the UI they want to appear via the plugin&rsquo;s setting screen. However, any changes affect all of the site&rsquo;s user experiences. Currently, there are no per-user settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first glance, the plugin seemed to work great. The hover outline experience felt smooth, and I did not need to change the default options. Wayfinder almost seemed to be everything one might look for in a block-outline solution. It was besting existing plugins in nearly every way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, things soon began rolling downhill when writing a typical blog post with nothing other than Heading, Paragraph, and Image blocks. I first noticed that I could not type the same number of words as usual on one line. My perfectly-tuned typography was breaking sooner than it should have. Spacing between paragraphs seemed a bit too large. My wide-aligned images were just a little smaller than usual.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user experience still felt good until this point, but the little oddities were stacking up. Something was not right. The plugin had been showered with praise on Twitter and already received three five-star reviews in its first 24 hours. Maybe my custom theme was the issue. However, similar problems arose when testing several others, such as Twenty Twenty-One, Nutmeg, and Eksell &mdash; each a well-rounded theme catered to the block editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As clean as the plugin&rsquo;s UI is, it more often than not wrecks the theme&rsquo;s default block spacing. This becomes more noticeable as users begin adding nested layers of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem is the plugin adds 18 pixels of padding around every block via its stylesheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>.wp-block:not(.block-list-appender) {\n    position: relative;\n    outline: 1px dashed transparent;\n    <strong>padding: 18px;</strong>\n    overflow: visible !important;\n}</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>To the untrained eye, this may not be a visible issue in many cases. It will affect each site differently, but 18 pixels of extra padding on every block will undoubtedly mess things up to some degree unless the theme itself uses that exact same spacing in its design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more noticeable issues are seen with blocks like Social Icons:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Holy moly! Those are some gigantic social icons!\n\n\n\n<p>But, even something as basic as a List block can be misaligned:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />List block shifted out of alignment.\n\n\n\n<p>Theme authors can write custom CSS to overrule the plugin&rsquo;s padding. However, the last thing the WordPress community needs is a specificity war between themes and plugins. Themers already have to do this enough to wrangle blocks now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Removing that one <code>padding</code> rule from the plugin&rsquo;s <code>editor-style.css</code> killed 99% of its issues. Afterward, things were running like a well-oiled machine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a developer, I would explore <code><a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/outline-offset\">outline-offset</a></code> for spacing between the block and its outline, maybe cutting that <code>18px</code> down a bit. Because outlines are not a part of the CSS box model, it would not affect spacing. Adjustments may be necessary on a per-block basis, especially when those blocks are nested or small (e.g., Social Icons, Navigation). It would carry its own challenges but should be a less destructive course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To a lesser extent, the plugin&rsquo;s <code>overflow</code> rule breaks the theme design from time to time. Its <code>position</code> and <code>outline</code> rules could overrule some edge-case block styles too, but they are necessary for the plugin to actually do its job. In particular, I could see positioning being problematic with sticky headers as we get into site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only other issue might be themes that use <code>::before</code> and <code>::after</code> pseudo-elements on blocks, but the plugin also needs to overwrite those to display the block name and classes list. This is likely another edge case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the issues, the plugin is ahead of the pack at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-blocks-border/\">Gutenberg Editor Full Width Blocks Border</a> (<em>a bit of a mouthful</em>), another recent plugin to offer similar functionality, breaks custom theme design across the board. It does accomplish the job of making blocks easier to select, but the sacrifice of a WYSIWYG is not worth it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editor-block-outline/\">Editor Block Outline</a> plugin has been my <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/navigate-the-content-canvas-with-the-block-editor-outline-wordpress-plugin\">go-to recommendation</a> for a while. It has a few design issues of its own, but some of those are adjustable on a per-user basis. However, as of late, it has made the editor feel sluggish. Plus, its misuse of the WordPress admin notice system for Twitter followers makes it something I&rsquo;d prefer to steer clear of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-options/\">EditorsKit</a> has a similar &ldquo;block guidelines&rdquo; feature that uses a box-shadow instead of padding and an outline. It does not muck up most theme layouts with that technique. However, I have hit other style conflicts with the plugin. Plus, EditorsKit is overkill for users who simply want just one feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That leaves us with Wayfinder. Warts and all, it is the best standalone option right now. Maybe that&rsquo;s not saying much, but it is saying something. This is a feature that is hard to nail down.  I do not envy the developers who are trying to make miracles happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is sure to please many who have been on the lookout for a block outline solution. It is in a position to pull farther ahead of the competition with its relatively solid first outing. With more thorough theme testing and a bit of adjustment to its approach, it could be even better. I am eager to test future iterations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 01:56:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"WordPress.org blog: People of WordPress: Tijana Andrejic\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10427\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/06/people-of-wordpress-tijana-andrejic/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13617:\"<p><strong>WordPress is open source software, maintained by a global network of contributors. There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This month to coincide with WordCamp Europe, we feature Tijana Andrejic from Belgrade, Serbia, about her journey from fitness trainer to the WordPress world, with the freelance and corporate opportunities it introduced. </p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"387\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/06/2021-07-Tijana-Andrejic_Featured-Img_1.jpg?resize=632%2C387&ssl=1\" alt=\"Tijana - portrait picture\" class=\"wp-image-10713\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As a professional manager with a college degree in Organizational Science and a certified fitness instructor, Tijana is nothing if not driven and goal-oriented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following her time as a fitness trainer, Tijana moved to work in IT around 2016. She first explored content creation and design before focusing on SEO and becoming an independent specialist.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana was hired as a Customer Happiness Engineer for a hosting company, where she discovered the benefits of having a team. She realized that having close working relationships with colleagues is helpful for business success and accelerates personal growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana hopes that by sharing her story, she can help others who are either starting their career or are moving roles. She describes the opportunities she discovered in the WordPress community as ‘a huge epiphany’, especially in the world of freelancing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She highlights <strong>5 things that helped her to start a new freelancing career</strong>. Let’s dive into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What motivates me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Why am I doing this?” is the first question that Tijana asks herself before starting anything new. This self-review and honesty, she feels, allows her to determine her priorities. She also benchmarks options around her motivations of wanting a flexible schedule and to grow professionally.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She lists the reasons to make a particular choice, like being a freelancer, to help her choose the right job, pathway, or identify alternatives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She recommends that others can take a similar approach. If freelancing is still the best solution after examining all their goals and motivations, Tijana believes a good next step would be to learn WordPress-related skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/cdHeIL-H_mE6QFCUxUT-gfKS2GzizRHtn4iCENoaWOimC82BfModRJh44QbhvHPW0GNVP5eUPhgxQteDRbA_9EUzpssTXMGWje1hUuKyrfXUgGhCnvXQdraaUQiaGBjFr73dNYxr\" alt=\"WordCamp Europe 2019 group picture\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Develop WordPress related skills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The next question you may ask: “Why WordPress?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is used by more than 40% of websites in some form and offers various roles, many of which are not developer-specific. Tijana highlights a few:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>web developer (coding websites, themes, and plugins)</li><li>web implementor (creating websites from existing themes without coding)</li><li>web designer (designing website mock-ups, editing images, or creating online infographics)</li><li>client support professional (helping people with their websites)</li><li>website maintenance (WordPress, themes, and plugins are maintained and backed up regularly)</li><li>WordPress trainer (helping clients with how to use the platform or teaching other web professionals)</li><li>content writer</li><li>accessibility specialist (making sure standards are met and suggesting solutions for accessibility barriers)</li><li>SEO consultant (improving search outcomes and understanding)</li><li>statistics consultant, especially for web shops</li><li>WordPress assistant (adding new content and editing existing posts)</li><li>website migration specialist (moving websites from one server to another)</li><li>web security specialist</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/16XExYT_P4R4PX3orOaWbueDfkBIA6PFQ-CuYEXdeN9AvUIuIF33aIjT1DpdnFCqhrijWv1f68OR2Qh14xGT9REHGJ-MqK-OxJ9XcrhZ3IkcW8DBI7nVAtvFcCnCHL0woka_FV6t\" alt=\"WCBGD group picture\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasized: “Another reason why WordPress is great for freelancers is the strong community that exists around this content management system (CMS).&#8221; WordCamps and Meetups are a way to get useful information and meet people from a large and very diverse community and get answers to many questions straight away.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past year, these events have been primarily online. However, the contributors who run them continue to make an effort to provide an experience as close to in-person events as possible. The biggest advantage to online events is that we can attend events from across the world, even if sometimes during these difficult times, it is difficult to get enough time to deeply into this new experience. Since Tijana’s first Meetup, she has attended many WordPress community events and volunteered as a speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plan in advance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Becoming a freelancer takes time. For Tijana, success came with proper planning and following her plan to ‘acquire or improve relevant skills that will make you stand out in the freelance market.’ She strongly believes that learning and growing as a professional opens more business opportunities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering a freelance career, she advises improving relevant skills or developing new skills related to your hobbies as ‘there is nothing better than doing what you love.’ In cases where no previous experience and knowledge can be used, she suggests choosing ‘a job that has a shorter learning curve and builds your knowledge around that.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana started as a content creator and learned to become an SEO expert. However, she highlights many alternative paths, including starting as a web implementer and moving to train as a developer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She suggests to others: “It would be a good idea to analyze the market before you jump into the learning process.” She also recommends people check the latest trends and consider the future of the skills they are developing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visit the new <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress.org</a> to see what topics are of interest to you. In this newly established resource, the WordPress community aggregates workshops to support those who want to start and improve their skills, provides lesson plans for professional WordPress trainers and helps you create personal learning to develop key skills. There is also material on helping you be part of and organize events for your local community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights that there are many places for freelancers to find clients. For example, the WordPress Community has a place where companies and individual site owners publish their job advertisements&nbsp; &#8211; <a href=\"https://jobs.wordpress.net/\">Jobs.WordPress.net</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Hurray, it’s time to get a first freelancing job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As a pragmatic person, Tijana recommends: “Save money before quitting your job to become a full-time freelancer. Alternatively, try freelancing for a few hours per week to see if you like it. Although some people do benefit when taking a risk, think twice before you take any irreversible actions.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She shared some possible next steps:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>use a freelancing platform</li><li>triple-check your resume</li><li>professionally present yourself</li><li>fill up your portfolio with examples</li><li>use video material</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“By using video material, your clients will not see you like a list of skills and previous experiences, but as a real person that has these skills and experiences and that provides a certain service for them.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “Have a detailed strategy when choosing your first employer. Choose your first employer wisely, very wisely. I can’t emphasize enough how important this is”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Tijana took her first freelancing job, she considered the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>how was the employer rated by other freelancers who worked for him previously</li><li>how does the employer rate other freelancers</li><li>how much money had they already spent on the platform</li><li>the number of open positions for a specific job and the number of freelancers that have already applied&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>“The first job is not all about the money. Don’t get greedy on your first job. If you get good recommendations, your second job can pay two to three times more. And your third job can go up to five times more. That was my experience.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Take responsibility as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana reminds us: “Freedom often comes with responsibility; individual responsibility is key when it comes to freelancing.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She advises others not to take a job if you can not make a deadline and have someone reliable who can help you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Missing deadlines will cost your client money and affect the review the client will be willing to leave about your job, and this can have a big impact on your future opportunities or freelance jobs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She adds: “This can start a downward spiral for your career. However, we are all humans, and unpredictable things can happen. If for some reason you are not able to complete your work in a timely manner, let your client know immediately so they can have enough time to hire someone else”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana emphasizes the importance of making expectations clear before accepting a job, both what the client is expecting and what you can expect from the client.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lastly, she points out that if you are working from home, your friends and family should treat you the way they would if you were in an office. She advises: “Let them know about your working schedule.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She hopes that these basic guidelines will be useful in launching freelance careers, as they did her, even though there is no universal recipe for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tijana highlights: “It’s just important to stay focused on your goals and to be open to new opportunities.” Freelancing wasn’t the only way she could have fulfilled her goals, but it was an important part of her path, and it helped her be confident in her abilities to make the next big step in her life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a freelancer, she was missing close relationships with colleagues and teamwork, which she has now found in her current firm. Her colleagues describe her as a: “walking-talking bundle of superpowers: sports medicine and fitness professional, SEO expert, blogger, designer and a kitty foster mum”.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/PIGT9R6FmtEHsNBvWzyViW5htRAm156asTOsohOGOUwfsWjW1TuDhUI9yuZnjIe-1eFHfFUWPULPtw82P3YYXHa0bsY_jA5keelmDHfSkTdd3xUsVZTmG9KvdE8XTojvU3LxYCsi\" alt=\"Conference reception\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you are considering starting your career as a freelancer, take the courses offered at <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">learn.wordpress.org,</a> reach out to companies that you would be interested in working with, and remember that there are a whole host of opportunities in the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">The WordPress.org Teams</a> &#8211; what they do, when and where they meet</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress resource</a> &#8211; free to use to expand your knowledge and skills of using the platform and learning about the community around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 3-day <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Europe 2021</a> online event begins on 7 June 2021.

Australian co-founders Russell Ivanovic and Philip Simpson are staying on to continue leading Pocket Casts as a part of the acquisition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The app allows users to keep all of their podcast subscriptions together in one place and sync between platforms. Previously a commercial-only app, Pocket Casts has been free since it switched to the freemium model in September 2019. Its creators have been monetizing the app through its Pocket Cast Plus tier, which gives users access to desktop apps, cloud storage, watch playback, and themes and icons for $9.99/year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In May 2018, Pocket Casts was acquired by public media organizations NPR, WNYC Studios, WBEZ Chicago, and This American Life. BBC Studios also held a small ownership stake in the platform prior to Automattic&rsquo;s acquisition. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being widely regarded as one of the best podcasting apps available, NPR&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://media.npr.org/documents/about/statements/fy2020/National%20Public%20Radio%20-%20Consolidated%20Financial%20Statements%202020.pdf\">financial statements and auditor&rsquo;s report from 2020</a> shows a net loss of more than $800K. The board governing the company met in December 2020 and agreed to sell Pocket Casts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No financial details of the acquisition were disclosed but Automattic may have gotten a bargain on Pocket Casts if its other owners were also losing money. After acquiring <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-tumblr-plans-to-rebuild-the-backend-powered-by-wordpress\">Tumblr</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-acquires-day-one-journaling-app\">Day One</a>, Automattic is starting to gain a reputation for buying up apps that people love to use and giving them a fighting chance at financial stability and longevity. The company has also demonstrated a growing interest in podcasting-related technologies with its  recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/castos-picks-up-756k-in-funding-from-automattic-and-joost-de-valk-to-expand-services-in-the-private-podcasting-market\">investment in Castos</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2021/02/22/turn-your-wordpress-com-blog-into-a-podcast-with-anchor/\">partnership with Spotify&rsquo;s Anchor</a> podcast creation platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Acquisition announcements often include assurances of no changes for current customers but Automattic&rsquo;s post made no promises and did not share many details regarding its plans for Pocket Casts. Integration with WordPress.com may be on the horizon but it&rsquo;s currently in the exploration stage. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As part of Automattic, Pocket Casts will continue to provide you with the features needed to enjoy your favorite podcasts (or find something new),&rdquo; Automattic&rsquo;s Head of Apps Eli Budelli said.&nbsp;&ldquo;We will explore building deep integrations with WordPress.com and Pocket Casts, making it easier to distribute and listen to podcasts.

This particular experiment groups people together based on browsing habits and labels them using machine learning. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>FLoC&rsquo;s trial was scheduled to end Jul 13, 2021, and Google has decided to remove the project from the testing phase while analyzing feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve decided not to extend this initial Origin Trial,&rdquo; Google senior software engineer Josh Karlin said in <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/blink-dev/c/MmijXrmwrJs/m/f0Nc6h-KAQAJ\">thread</a> on Chromium&rsquo;s Blink Developers group forum. &ldquo;Instead, we&rsquo;re hard at work on improving FLoC to incorporate the feedback we&rsquo;ve heard from the community before advancing to further ecosystem testing.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The controversial experiment has been met with opposition from privacy advocates like makers of the <a href=\"https://brave.com/why-brave-disables-floc/\">Brave</a> browser and <a href=\"https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/03/googles-floc-terrible-idea\">EFF</a> who do not perceive FLoC to be a compelling alternative to the surveillance business model currently used by the advertising industry. Amazon, GitHub, Firefox, Vivaldi, Drupal, Joomla, DuckDuckGo, and other major tech companies and open source projects have already opted to block FLoC by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, Twitter has been the first major online platform that <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2021/07/05/twitter-appears-to-be-on-board-with-googles-floc-initiative/\">appears to be on board with FLoC</a> after references to it were recently discovered in the app&rsquo;s source code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google&rsquo;s initial efforts in presenting FLoC failed to gain broad support, which may have contributed to the company putting the brakes on its plan to phase out third-party cookies in Chrome by 2022. As the advertising industry yields to pressure from the last few years of privacy legislation, third-party cookies will be on their way out in what is colloquially known as the &ldquo;Cookie Apocalypse.&rdquo; Google has <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/\">postponed</a> this milestone for Chrome to begin in mid-2023 and end in late 2023.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We need to move at a responsible pace,&rdquo; Chrome Privacy Engineering Director Vinay Goel said. &ldquo;This will allow sufficient time for public discussion on the right solutions, continued engagement with regulators, and for publishers and the advertising industry to migrate their services. This is important to avoid jeopardizing the business models of many web publishers which support freely available content.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussion on a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/53069\">proposal for WordPress to block FLoC</a> has stalled in Trac but may have been premature in the first place if FLoC doesn&rsquo;t end making it to further testing. Proponents of blocking FLoC saw WordPress&rsquo; support or opposition as critical to the success or failure of FLoC adoption on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A recent article on the WordPress.com VIP blog titled &ldquo;<a href=\"https://wpvip.com/2021/06/23/goodbye-third-party-cookies-hello-googles-floc/\">Goodbye, Third-Party Cookies, Hello Google&rsquo;s FloC,</a>&rdquo; indicates that Automattic may be straddling the fence on the controversial new technology:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>FLoC has its plus points. But it isn&rsquo;t as privacy-focused as we would like, and can lead to discriminatory practices, as described above. Then there&rsquo;s the concern of letting Google dominate yet another aspect of tech. Google also plans to charge any third-party tracking company for use of any of the data it has collected.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For the time being, it looks like major tech platforms are off the hook for taking an active position on FLoC since it has been sent back for major modifications. In the most recently <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/updated-timeline-privacy-sandbox-milestones/\">updated timeline</a> for Privacy Sandbox milestones, Vinay Goel said Google received &ldquo;substantial feedback from the web community during the origin trial for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/chrome/privacy-sustainability-and-the-importance-of-and/\">first version</a>&nbsp;of FLoC.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the conclusion of its origin trial, FLoC seems far from ready for adoption, having failed to gain a foothold in the industry. The concern is that Google may ram FLoC through anyway using the weight of Chrome&rsquo;s market share, despite the web community&rsquo;s chilly reception. Although these proposed changes to ad tech will impact the entire industry, as well as regular internet users, <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2021/07/08/google_floc_changes/\">Google does not intend to disclose any of the private feedback</a> the company received during FLoC&rsquo;s origin trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The main summary of that feedback will be the next version, and you can surmise based on what features (and the reasoning for these changes) are available in the next version,&rdquo; Google mathematician Michael Kleber said during a recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/lukOlejnik/status/1413096551359123457\">Web Commerce Interest Group (WCIG) meeting</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Privacy advocates want to see more transparency incorporated into this process so that major concerns are not left unaddressed, instead of leaving it to stakeholders across the web to try to deduce what Google has solved in the next version of FLoC. Overhauling the advertising industry with new technologies should be done in the open if these changes are truly intended to protect people&rsquo;s privacy.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 03:26:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"WPTavern: Edupack Is Tackling Higher Ed With WordPress, Looking for Development Partners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119928\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:219:\"https://wptavern.com/edupack-is-tackling-higher-ed-with-wordpress-looking-for-development-partners?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=edupack-is-tackling-higher-ed-with-wordpress-looking-for-development-partners\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6721:\"<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re basically building the Jetpack for Higher Ed,&rdquo; said Blake Bertuccelli as he pitched me on the idea of <a href=\"https://edupack.dev/\">Edupack</a>, a project still in its early stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He and his team are looking for more advisors to <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/braintrust-008-wordpress-blocks-for-higher-ed-pros-tickets-163114043495\">join the eighth round</a> of their once-monthly braintrust events. It is a project they began in November 2020, now coming to fruition. Feedback is crucial to pushing such undertakings out of the gate, and the team needs more of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bertuccelli listed several focal points for the Edupack project:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> New campus users can set up a beautiful campus WordPress site with a few clicks.</li><li><strong>Archiving:</strong> Stale sites are automatically archived to save campus resources.</li><li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Accessibility, plagiarism, and resource usage can be accessed from the Edupack dashboard.</li><li><strong>Brand and Content Management:</strong> Approved Higher Ed content patterns and universal brand controls keep sites beautiful and consistent.</li><li><strong>Configuration Management:</strong> Cloud-controlled configuration settings means admins can control millions of sites from one place.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<img />Onboarding form with Tulane-branded elements.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our onboarding form offers pre-built sites for users to start from,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;So, if a scientist needs a new site for their lab, the scientist can select a pre-built lab site from our onboarding form then add in their unique content.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bertuccelli is Edupack&rsquo;s CEO. He called himself a &ldquo;forever learner&rdquo; and is currently reading <em>A History of Western Philosophy</em> by Bertrand Russell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I paid for my Tulane education by coding WordPress themes,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;After college, I founded one of New Orleans&rsquo; first WordPress dev shops (<a href=\"https://decubing.com/\">Decubing</a>). A year ago, I presented on building a self-publishing platform with Multisite at WP Campus. The feedback was phenomenal, and two blokes from Birmingham offered to work on a plugin with me. A few months later, we launched Edupack&rsquo;s MVP. Since then, folks from Harvard, Dartmouth, and about 17 other universities have been working with us to make WordPress an even better CMS for Higher Ed pros.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;two blokes&rdquo; he is referring to are his co-founders, Nathan Monk and Matt Lees. They run a WordPress shop called <a href=\"http://wearesmile.com/\">SMILE</a>. Monk is serving as Edupack&rsquo;s CTO. Lees is the Chief Creative Officer &mdash; Bertuccelli called him &ldquo;Lord of the UX.&rdquo; Altogether, the three co-founders have over 30 years of experience working with Higher Ed and WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Edupack team is making accessible content a priority, which is a primary issue for Higher Ed. The goal is to offer A11Y reports inside of the WordPress dashboard and tie them into publishing workflows. This would notify users of errors as they publish content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our accessibility reports tie into another feature we are launching this month: site archiving,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;Campus users graduate and often forget about their sites. Edupack sends a notification to a user if the site hasn&rsquo;t been accessed, then adds an &ldquo;archived&rdquo; meta value to the site that super administrators can take action from.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Setting up automated archiving.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Devs often recode thousands of sites to add new Campus branding,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli on the reasons behind Edupack. &ldquo;Department budgets are drained on resources for stale sites. Institutions are sued over inaccessible content or misused branding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Edupack intends to automate website management so that Higher Ed pros can focus on supporting education.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following video is an introduction to Edupack:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h2>Join the Braintrust Session</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Every third Wednesday of each month, Edupack holds a &ldquo;Braintrust&rdquo; event. Bertuccelli says it is the best way to get involved. The session lasts for an hour over a Zoom video chat. The <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/braintrust-008-wordpress-blocks-for-higher-ed-pros-tickets-163114043495\">next event is scheduled</a> for July 21, 10 am &ndash; 11 am (CDT).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each session focuses on a single question. Next week&rsquo;s question: &ldquo;How can we enhance WordPress blocks for Higher Ed?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll demo Edupack updates, brainstorm solutions for block enhancements, then wrap up with action steps for us to do by next month,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;Folks who manage WordPress sites for global institutions and companies have attended our last seven braintrusts. Any Higher Ed pro is welcome!&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those interested can also keep track of progress via the <a href=\"https://joinedupack.wordpress.com/\">Edupack blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Pricing and the Future</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">There is currently no publicly available pricing list. The project&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://edupack.dev/frequently-asked-questions/\">FAQs page</a> says the team is still tuning the costs, and Bertuccelli remained quiet on any hard numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Community colleges can&rsquo;t afford tech used by bigger schools,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not fair. Edupack will be priced so that every institution can afford the service. We haven&rsquo;t thought about pricing beyond that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Universities that wish to get check out the project should schedule a demo from the site&rsquo;s homepage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edupack has around 20 institutions serving as development partners and guiding <a href=\"https://github.com/orgs/joinedupack/projects/2\">the roadmap</a>. The team invites new schools to join every few months. Currently, Tulane and the University of Gloucestershire are using Edupack. Harvard and Dartmouth should be next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service is limited to universities and colleges at the moment. However, the team would eventually like to expand across the education sector. After that, we will have to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Edupack&rsquo;s features can be applied to any industry where users run lots of sites,&rdquo; said Bertuccelli. &ldquo;I could see ad agencies using Edupack, hosting companies integrating our tools, and School Districts running their site network via Edupack and WordPress.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 02:07:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:46:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 9.0.0 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=319979\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://buddypress.org/2021/07/buddypress-9-0-0-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4379:\"<p><strong>Important note</strong>: this BuddyPress release was built in a short time frame (<em>we even skipped the beta release</em>) to be ready for the release of WordPress 5.8.

With so many enhancements headed our way, even we have not been able to keep up with them all here at WP Tavern. The next release will bring a few much-needed media-related upgrades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users should enjoy WebP image format support and a copy-to-clipboard button on the media upload screen. Developers have a new hook for filtering the image output format, and the platform is dropping infinite scrolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 is scheduled to ship on July 20, so these changes will be landing in less than a week. If you have not already done so, give <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/wordpress-5-8-release-candidate-3/\">WordPress 5.8 Release Candidate 3</a> a test run and report any issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Infinite Scroll Replaced With Ajax Button</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Media Library screen (first) and overlay (second) with &ldquo;load more&rdquo; buttons. \n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The upcoming core release will <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/50105\">drop infinite scrolling</a> for media in favor of an Ajax-powered &ldquo;Load more&rdquo; button. The admin screen and editor&rsquo;s media overlay will cap the initial and subsequent &ldquo;pages&rdquo; to 40 media items each.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This change is a part of an effort from the WordPress accessibility team to improve the experience for end-users. Team member and core contributor Andrea Fercia noted <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40330\">two a11y problems with infinite scrolling</a>. The first is that it is impossible or nearly for keyboard users to reach content appended to the screen. Second, there is no audible feedback or instructions about how infinite scrolling works for screen readers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also noted usability and performance issues. Infinite scroll can break the browser&rsquo;s history, and there is no JavaScript fallback. And loading hundreds or more large-sized images increases the memory footprint.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the media library is getting the Ajax treatment in WordPress 5.8, we should expect similar updates for other areas in the future, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Add Themes Screen</li><li>Customizer &gt; Add Menu Items</li><li>Editor &gt; Link &gt; Search</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Copy URL From Add New Media Screen</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Copy URL to clipboard button on the Add New Media screen.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">This change is an enhancement that rids the platform of a small but noticeable nuisance that has plagued it for years. When uploading an image from the Media &gt; Add New screen in the WordPress admin, there was no way to grab its URL without clicking over to the edit screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 introduces a &ldquo;Copy URL to clipboard&rdquo; button that appears after the image has been uploaded. No need to leave the page and track down the URL. The change also makes the user experience consistent with the Media Library screen and overlay in the post editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More often than not, browsing Trac means seeing many of the same names. This time around, it seems that a regular user wanted a feature. They created an account &mdash; perhaps for this purpose alone &ndash;, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/add-a-copy-link-button-at-the-media-upload-page/\">wrote a support forum post</a>, was directed to Trac, and <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/51754\">created their first ticket</a>. It took eight months to work its way into WordPress, but it is one of those success stories of an average user making things happen by just providing feedback. Thanks for the contribution, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/anotia/\">@anotia</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WebP Image Format Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">WordPress is allowing a new image format. And, no, it is <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24251\">not SVG</a> (technically not an image). There are still security hurdles to jump for that to ever happen. However, it now supports WebP, which carries with it the promise of better performance for those who use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Sarah Gooding <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-introduces-support-for-webp-images\">reported for WP Tavern</a> last month:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>This modern image file format was created by Google in September 2010, and is now supported by 95% of the web browsers in use worldwide. It has distinct advantages over more commonly used formats, providing both lossless and lossy compression that is 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs and 25-34% smaller than comparable JPEG images.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In the report, she noted that only 1.6% (<a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/im-webp\">currently at 1.8%</a>) of the top 10 million websites used the WebP format. With WordPress now adding support, that percentage is likely to rise in the coming years.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developers: Image Editor Output Format Hook</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For developers who want to transform images with one mime type to another, 5.8 introduces the <code>image_editor_output_format</code> <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/52867\">filter hook</a>. Plugin authors can convert all newly uploaded images or only overwrite specific formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following example converts JPG images to the new WebP format:</p>\n\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><code>add_filter( \'image_editor_output_format\', function( $formats ) {\n        $formats[\'image/jpeg\'] = \'image/webp\';\n\n        return $formats;\n} );</code></pre>\n\n\n\n<p>The output format will be applied to all image sub-sizes as they are created. However, this will only work for WebP images if the webserver supports it.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 03:09:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:103:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Patches Critical Vulnerability, Sending Forced Security Update from WordPress.org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=120008\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:249:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-patches-critical-vulnerability-sending-forced-security-update-from-wordpress-org?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=woocommerce-patches-critical-vulnerability-sending-forced-security-update-from-wordpress-org\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3619:\"<p>WooCommerce has <a href=\"https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/2564657/\">patched</a> an unspecified, critical vulnerability identified on July 13, 2021, by a security researcher through Automattic&rsquo;s HackerOne security program. The vulnerability impacts versions 3.3 to 5.5 of the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://woocommerce.us8.list-manage.com/track/click?u=2c1434dc56f9506bf3c3ecd21&id=8ff0a5345f&e=0110b26bc5\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce</a> plugin, as well as version 2.5 to 5.5 of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">WooCommerce Blocks</a> feature plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Upon learning about the issue, our team immediately conducted a thorough investigation, audited all related codebases, and created a patch fix for every impacted version (90+ releases) which was deployed automatically to vulnerable stores,&rdquo; WooCommerce Head of Engineering Beau Lebens said in the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/critical-vulnerability-detected-july-2021/\">security announcement</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.org is currently pushing out forced automatic updates to vulnerable stores, a practice that is rarely employed to mitigate potentially severe security issues impacting a large number of sites. Even with the automatic update, WooCommerce merchants are encouraged to check that their stores are running the latest version (5.5.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since WooCommerce backported this security fix to every release branch back to 3.3, store owners using older versions of WooCommerce can safely update to the highest number in their current release branch even if not running the very latest 5.5.1 version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of publishing, only 7.2% of WooCommerce installations are using version 5.5+. More than half of stores (51.7%) are running on a version older than 5.1. WordPress.org doesn&rsquo;t offer a more specific breakdown of the older versions, but it&rsquo;s safe to say without these backported security fixes, the majority of WooCommerce installs might be left vulnerable.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The security announcement indicates that WooCommerce cannot yet confirm that this vulnerability has not been exploited:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Our investigation into this vulnerability and whether data has been compromised is ongoing. We will be sharing more information with site owners on how to investigate this security vulnerability on their site, which we will publish on our blog when it is ready. If a store was affected, the exposed information will be specific to what that site is storing but could include order, customer, and administrative information.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are concerned about possible exploitation, the WooCommerce team is <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/critical-vulnerability-detected-july-2021/#comment-19937832\">recommending merchants update their passwords</a> after installing the patched version as a cautionary measure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The good news for WooCommerce store owners is that this particular critical vulnerability was responsibly disclosed and patched within one day after it was identified. The plugin&rsquo;s team has committed to being transparent about the security issue. In addition to publishing an announcement on the plugin&rsquo;s blog, WooCommerce also emailed everyone who has opted into their mailing list. Concerned store owners should keep an eye on the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/blog/\">WooCommerce blog</a> for a follow-up post on how to investigate if their stores have been compromised.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 01:51:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: #5 – Robert Jacobi on Why He’s Putting Gutenberg First\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=119987\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:173:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/5-robert-jacobi-on-why-hes-putting-gutenberg-first?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=5-robert-jacobi-on-why-hes-putting-gutenberg-first\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56963:\"<h2>About this episode.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have Robert Jacobi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Robert is Director of WordPress at Cloudways.

I&rsquo;ve been in the open source space, wow, for almost 20 years, I&rsquo;m feeling old and actually got my raising on open source with the Joomla project, which is a hundred percent volunteer, open source content management system as well, and picked up WordPress slowly got into there. And boy, that&rsquo;s a lot of ands.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I love the community. I love the greater goal. That open source, espouses and tries to reach. And we&rsquo;re never, always successful. But having code and information more freely accessible is something I really believe in. And I think empowers people globally and provides opportunities that wouldn&rsquo;t happen if these ones and zeros were siloed away in golden towers. I&rsquo;m always just so tickled to talk about open source and all the interesting things we can do with it. It powers communities, it powers, politics, powers, freedoms, it powers companies. It&rsquo;s really amazing. And we talk about WordPress all the time as one of the defining tools in this space. You look at something like Linux, which pretty much literally everything uses these days. It&rsquo;s crazy how, to use Matt Mullenweg&rsquo;s, favorite phrase, these things democratize all of us in so many different ways.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:05:39]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We&rsquo;ve got a really broad pallet of things that we&rsquo;re going to discuss today, ranging from Gutenberg, right through to WordCamps and all sorts. So we&rsquo;ll crack on with the smorgasbord of what we&rsquo;ve got to discuss. The first of our little laundry list is Gutenberg. You wanted to talk to us a bit today about Gutenberg, what you think of it, and so on. There was an event that I attended recently, which you were also in attendance at, and you were on a panel there, and you mentioned that in the face of proprietary page builders, you always had the approach that Gutenberg should be the first relation. It should come first. And I&rsquo;m curious to know, what did you mean by that? What is Gutenberg first? What is this approach?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:06:17]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So Gutenberg first to me is that we recognize the benefits of Gutenberg, and don&rsquo;t try to subvert them or sneak around them. I think Gutenberg is one of the most critical backend, frontend changes that has happened to WordPress in its last umpteen years and the potential for all the interesting future forward things that Gutenberg can do should be taken into account. So page builders are wonderful. They offer all this functionality, ease of use, but I think that, they should also take and utilize Gutenberg concurrently.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The advantages are, one, that Gutenberg&rsquo;s not going anywhere. So God bless all the classic editor folk who loved that experience. More than just being deprecated, it&rsquo;s just, that is not going to be the way of the future.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And secondly, the potential, what can happen when you start making all that content a bit more atomic. I come from a lot of database work. So you think of atomic data points and Gutenberg does that sort of automagically for you? So there are opportunities in the future with Gutenberg to start parcing that data more finely.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>That&rsquo;s why I think it&rsquo;s very exciting and why everything should be Gutenberg first. Again, that doesn&rsquo;t mean get rid of page builders or different types of themes and theming systems. It&rsquo;s just that at the base, Gutenberg should be a core building block of what you&rsquo;re working with going forward.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:07:51]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The way that I think many people are using Gutenberg at the moment, I should probably say the block editor, but if you&rsquo;re using the Gutenberg plugin, you&rsquo;ll obviously have an enhanced experience. But if you&rsquo;re using the block editor at the moment, it feels as if it&rsquo;s prime time for editing text, inserting images and some pretty basic stuff like that. But I can see on the horizon a whole plethora of interesting, curious, let&rsquo;s call them plug-ins for now, because that&rsquo;s what they are. Different block components, different plugins, which adapt and amend the capability of Gutenberg. And it feels to me as if that&rsquo;s where its strength might lie. I know we&rsquo;ve got the full site editing and all of that coming down the road, but it feels to me that, there&rsquo;s going to be a whole plethora of third-party tools, bringing all sorts of added benefits into the ecosystem, a block for this thing, and a block for that thing. And whilst that might create some kind of bloat, that to me is an exciting area, and I just wondered if that&rsquo;s something you&rsquo;re interested in, if there&rsquo;s any plugins or blocks that you&rsquo;ve been looking at and thinking, oh, that&rsquo;s curious. That seems to be stretching things a little bit.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:08:55]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So, you make a, first of all, great point that there&rsquo;s block editor and then Gutenberg platform as a whole, and what end users typically experience is the block editor, but the Gutenberg API, Gutenberg platform as a whole is going to allow for all sorts of crazy third party integrations. That&rsquo;s great. And it might even be a little, you said the perfect word, there might be a bit of bloat and craziness. I&rsquo;ll say that&rsquo;ll probably exist for the next 12 to 24 months. Sure, that&rsquo;s fine. As people figure out what works and doesn&rsquo;t. This is a dawn of a new age around taking WordPress to the next step. We&rsquo;ve talked about for many years, WordPress is just a blog, blah, blah, blah. Okay. We&rsquo;ve gotten past WordPress as a blog. Now WordPress as a CMS. That&rsquo;s great. I think what happens with Gutenberg is we look at it and say, WordPress is an application platform, and this is just another API that we can take advantage of in very different ways. So we can have forums that are much more catered to content creators, that get rid of all the WordPress backend and admin stuff. Okay, you&rsquo;re authenticated. You&rsquo;re logged in. Here&rsquo;s your daily news forum that you&rsquo;re going to add content to. And because we&rsquo;re using Gutenberg, that makes it a lot easier to publish that content and gets rid of the technical cruft, and allows developers and third-party plugin providers to have wholly unique and valuable experiences around that. And that&rsquo;s where the magic I think of Gutenberg really comes into play is where will all these third parties start finding those unique value propositions for specific content, whether it&rsquo;s an, a vertical, like travel or e-commerce, in a generic sense or news or publications or whatnot. It&rsquo;s really expanded the opportunities to create workflows and interfaces and make content production speedier and safer.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:10:55]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think one of the curious things that I&rsquo;ve observed over the last couple of years about it is that perhaps if we had the magic rewind button, we could go back a couple of years and potentially not really get into a conversation where it was&hellip; okay, we&rsquo;ve got stage 1, 2, 3, and 4, and stages two, three, and four, start to add in functionality that things like page builders, can currently do, full site editing and all that. If it had just been touted as, we&rsquo;ve got a new editor for you, here it is, I think it would have taken people along for the ride much more easily, but we&rsquo;ve got this problem now, this impasse where, it got sold as it&rsquo;s going to become a page builder, but the pace of development and the fact that they&rsquo;ve got the legacy of 40 percent of the web, 40 plus percent of the web, to protect and so on it hasn&rsquo;t been able to move in that direction potentially at the speed that people thought&hellip; well, it&rsquo;s going to be a page builder. It hasn&rsquo;t been able to mature at the rate that they would have liked to have done. And so I&rsquo;m just curious in the next year, two years, whether it will do those things, but also I wish we could rewind and say look, slow down. Let&rsquo;s get the editor experience sussed out first, then we&rsquo;ll do the full site editing and don&rsquo;t expect it to be all these things. Beause at the minute I hear a lot of people saying it&rsquo;s not as good as the tool I&rsquo;ve got over here, and it&rsquo;s not as good as the tool I&rsquo;ve got over there. Speaking of which do you think there&rsquo;s a case where it isn&rsquo;t the best tool where you would say actually, do you know what, I&rsquo;m just going to relegate that and not use it first. Or is it literally, always the first thing in your toolkit for WordPress?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:12:28]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It is literally the first thing in my toolkit, because it will provide the greatest longevity in whatever&rsquo;s built. Gutenberg&rsquo;s not going anywhere. There was a massive commitment to it from the project side of the universe. And to answer one of your earlier questions about, has it done enough? I think it&rsquo;s exceeded all expectations and this is where I&rsquo;ll get to it. They&rsquo;re always going to be a voices like, okay, it doesn&rsquo;t make bacon and eggs for me in the morning. Okay, That&rsquo;s fine, it doesn&rsquo;t. I think, and I truly believe what the magic of Gutenberg is, is the paradigm shift in forcing people to look at other things. So it&rsquo;s hard to make a giant feature change in anything, whether it&rsquo;s proprietary project, open source project. There are going to be plenty of people who are like, no, this works for me. This is great. Please don&rsquo;t change. I get that. But technology moves forward. People&rsquo;s expectations increase. Ten years ago, we barely had iPhones. All of a sudden we do, and now we expect everything to be infinitely easier and simpler and more responsive. I guess it doesn&rsquo;t do everything that page builders do. That&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s fine. We&rsquo;re not trying to cut out the middle man here, and I say we, I&rsquo;m not actually involved directly in Gutenberg at any point, but it moves the technological user experience goal posts forward. All things being equal, the page builders of the world, Beaver Builder, Elementor, they&rsquo;re all going to go their own way. Having Gutenberg as a critical component, soon enough, it will be just a mandatory component, that&rsquo;s the end of the conversation. Says, listen, everyone, this is what we need as part of the ecosystem. This is how you&rsquo;re going to connect with tools. You can absolutely go around those, but why would you want to, because this will be supported by a worldwide community.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s not just going to be supported by the Beaver Builder community or the Elementor community, yada yada, this is now the new core and that&rsquo;s very difficult to do, and it&rsquo;s not, jumping back to what I said earlier about it, I think just making that change in and of itself and committing to that change is more important than full site editor or anything else. There&rsquo;ll be incremental steps, but that was the big milestone step. Wow. Okay. This is the new tech, and we&rsquo;re going to have to take advantage of it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:14:45]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You said two words in that last little bit, well you certainly said paradigm shift and you said atomic. And I think for me, the atomic bit is really interesting because what I think many people haven&rsquo;t had a chance to get to grips with is literally the atomic nature of it. This little section of your blog post or whatever it may be. You can just have this little interactive thing. It might be that you&rsquo;ve got a block which does, I don&rsquo;t know, lead generation, or you&rsquo;ve got a block, like the cover block, which will just take care of the top of your posts. And each one of those things will have a different array of settings and it doesn&rsquo;t have to be built inside a proprietary thing. It&rsquo;s being built inside of the default editor for WordPress. So it&rsquo;s going to bring a ton of functionality and a ton of interesting things. Some of it will be bloated. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be many people who fall into the trap of installing fifty times more than they need to, or five times more than they need to. But for those of us who were curious and check things out and look and see what the end result is, you&rsquo;re going to be able to create really unique experiences on this one surface, and that to me is really exciting, but have the feeling that the community got left behind in the conversation about this a little bit. So the confusion that it was going to be a page builder leads me to the whole community conversation. I know you&rsquo;re all about community. This is something that you thrive on. You love the WordPress community, as you have had loved many other communities in the past. Do you have any feelings around whether there&rsquo;s been enough involvement. Asking the questions, what should it look like? How should it behave? What do we want to leave on the floor and edit out that we just, it was a blind alley, we shouldn&rsquo;t have had that because there are some things that I think a really excellent, there are some things that I think I&rsquo;m not sure anybody&rsquo;s actually going to make use of that, but there it is. And just wondering what your thoughts were around, whether the community had been involved, whether it could have been involved more.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:16:38]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I&rsquo;m getting chuckles about a lot of these things. Could there have been more all the editing and whatnot. Since community is, especially in WordPress, a huge word, it&rsquo;s always difficult to get every stakeholder, give them the space, give them the time given the vote.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What I like about what happened with Gutenberg is that it did move, in my mind, relatively quickly, and expeditiously and said, this is what we&rsquo;re doing. And I think it&rsquo;s too easy to be bogged down in the politics of community to actually get stuff done. So if things fall to the wayside, if things were not edit out properly, that&rsquo;s where I think, the greater ecosystem can come into play and say, we&rsquo;re going to tweak this, with a plugin that makes this just a bit better. It takes this out and we have such a robust economy in WordPress. That yeah, go for it. I like to see a bit more activism from people as a whole on these projects, but it&rsquo;s hard. We all have day jobs. We all have stuff to do, and I&rsquo;m not going to blame the leaders of the project for trying to get stuff done. In fact, I&rsquo;m going to give them kudos to just doing it because it&rsquo;s very easy to get pulled back and say you didn&rsquo;t listen to so and so, at some point we have to fish or cut bait, we need to do something and we need to move the technology forward because everyone else is doing it. And open source projects have a tendency, especially at their, let&rsquo;s say late teens, early adult stages, getting sucked into managing the community more than managing the project and pushing it forward.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>You have to do both. It&rsquo;s such a tricky balance. All kudos to everyone at Make dot WordPress, that they were able to do this. And it&rsquo;s a large scale change and get it done. Fine, if you want to complain, that&rsquo;s great. Guess what? No software lives, at that moment in time, it&rsquo;s always updated and tweaked and there are still opportunities to make changes, advocate or different functionality. Expand the API, shrink the API, all those kinds of things. I do love that WordPress was able to cut bait and just go with it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:18:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>One of the underpinnings of WordPress since the inception really was PHP. And obviously now we&rsquo;re moving into an era where these technologies are being inspected, and improvements have been created along the way. And so now we&rsquo;re moving into an era where other technologies, for example, React is coming along and that requires quite a bit of relearning, you&rsquo;ve really got to down tools, get the manuals out, start to read again. Do you have any concern that that kind of thing could be a bit of a roadblock? It will be a bit of have a roadblock for certain people, but the technology has to move forward. Just curious as to what your thoughts are about how that&rsquo;s being implemented and whether or not we&rsquo;re taking it at a slow enough pace or whether we should have just stuck with good old PHP?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:19:29]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I like to use the right tool for the right projects, And I&rsquo;ve been a coder, developer, engineer in multiple languages. I&rsquo;ve actually never done anything with React, that&rsquo;s one of the first ones. And that&rsquo;s okay. We evolve. If we hadn&rsquo;t evolved all these still using C from 1969 or whenever it came out. So this stuff has to move forward. And if React is the best solution to do that on the front end, that&rsquo;s great.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Some people will be excited by that. Okay. I can expand my personal knowledge and horizons by adding to React. Honestly, a lot of the headless stuff that we see these days is also React. So it&rsquo;s not a bad thing to learn if you want to learn that. If you don&rsquo;t want to learn it. Okay, that&rsquo;s fine. There are plenty of opportunities to still expand your WordPress activities solely with PHP. Okay. Those are more personal choices. Do I want to learn another language? Do I want to improve on what I already have? Yes. Those are choices you have to make, but none of this lives in isolation. So we have to understand that a WordPress, plain old PHP site, might still need to connect up to a bunch of different things and not all those things are going to be on PHP. You still might be connecting up to something with Perl or Python. No, one&rsquo;s forcing you to learn it. Granted Gutenberg injects this react universe into your face, but you can focus on the core things that you need to do without necessarily running into React. It&rsquo;s a tool that more people are&hellip; here&rsquo;s the trick, there are plenty of new people who are entering coding, development, open source communities, and they like React. So it makes sense to take advantage of all this new found wealth, and then also draw them back into the community. Great, you love running with all this JS stuff. Fantastic. Hey, by the way, did you know you could actually implement that as part and parcel with an old-school PHP content management system? Yeah, we can do that. That&rsquo;s great. And look how you can expand your horizon. Yeah, it stinks if you don&rsquo;t want to learn any kind of Node, React stuff. Okay. But, it&rsquo;s sort of the nature of code. If we really want to take the analogy to the extreme, why aren&rsquo;t we still coding on punch cards with ones and zeros. We&rsquo;re going to abstract it and find the best tool to implement the functionality we want to see.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And I get it me personally, I&rsquo;m not going to go out and learn React today. Me twenty years ago, though, I would have added it into my tool belt in a heartbeat, just because it was just one of those things that you needed at that time, that was the case. People are going to go through their own personal and professional sort of life cycles of what they think they need to have on their knee or in their tool belt to be successful. We can&rsquo;t stop for people who don&rsquo;t want to do anything outside of PHP.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:22:04]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We&rsquo;re going to shift gears now and talk about in-person events. Under the auspices of things like WordCamp Europe, which is depending on when you&rsquo;re listening to this podcast that may just have happened, or it may be it&rsquo;s coming around in a year&rsquo;s time or something like that.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Clearly we&rsquo;ve been through a period that has really shaken the community. I feel that as a community, we were probably as well-prepared as any community could be because we were already working via the internet. We all had our computers out and so on. And yet still there is a concern. And I know that for example, people like Josepha Haden Chomposy has mentioned things like this, that the community in the absence of in-person events, there&rsquo;s been a modest disengagement. And what I mean by that, this is the project, the WordPress project was propelled forward in a large part by those in-person events. So you&rsquo;ve got contrib day, you&rsquo;ve just got the handshaking, you can actually meet people for the first time. You can build relationships and so on. And none of that&rsquo;s happened. We&rsquo;ve had a year out. We don&rsquo;t know quite when that is coming back, hopefully at some point in the near future, but we don&rsquo;t know. And so just curious about your thoughts on that. What do you have to say about events coming back and how a project as big as WordPress, where there&rsquo;s no central office where there&rsquo;s no boss telling everybody what to do. So if you&rsquo;re on the payroll, you&rsquo;ve got to do this today and fix this thing, but that&rsquo;s not how it works. And so the open source model, there may be a chink in its armor here where in-person events don&rsquo;t happen, that camaraderie and those solutions don&rsquo;t present themselves. And so the project, I&rsquo;m going to use the word stalls, that&rsquo;s a complete over-exaggeration, but bits of the project stalled because nobody&rsquo;s meeting up.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:23:49]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I am a huge, huge advocate of in-person anything. Whether you&rsquo;re extrovert or introvert, there&rsquo;s always going to be someone that you really want to talk to sit down in a corner, or have a cup of coffee with and build that relationship. I&rsquo;m no anthropologist or anything, but feel that those kinds of human connections help us grow stronger in light of all the mundane things we do day to day. I don&rsquo;t think the project has suffered because of a lack of in-person events over the last year. I think it&rsquo;s suffered because everyone else has had a lot on their mind and there&rsquo;ll be a, certainly a renaissance of activity as soon as we get into in person but this is one of those things where I don&rsquo;t think correlation and causation match up. If you are worried about friends and family getting ill, did the economy, my personal economies take a downturn. That&rsquo;s going to weigh a lot more on someone than, oh, did I catch up on the latest WordPress dot org, Slack notification about Full Site Editing. So I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re completely tied together, but I will certainly tell you that as those in-person meetups start ramping up, I think that&rsquo;ll be a flurry of excitement and activity. Part of that will be just because we&rsquo;re not still trapped in our tiny little Covid bubbles.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:25:12]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What personally do you miss from the in-person events?

With a completely regimented online experience, I know I&rsquo;m going to be talking with Nathan at such and such time. I know I&rsquo;m going to be talking to whoever everything&rsquo;s organized, calendars. Okay, there&rsquo;s digital here, digital there. We may edit ourselves more on these platforms. When you&rsquo;re in-person accidents happen. We may be walking through the sponsor hall and accidentally bump shoulders. And it&rsquo;s oh my goodness, Nathan, great to see you. I haven&rsquo;t seen you in 14 months. This is amazing. And you just start a conversation and those kinds of conversations are organic and random and not necessarily so overly planned and well thought out. And at those moments, I think unique ideas, exciting things can happen that just don&rsquo;t happen in a much more shrunken space. I love the distributed world. And to your point, I think WordPress is not only just gone through well, it&rsquo;s actually succeeded because we&rsquo;ve already been in that position. We&rsquo;re already ready to be online and take care of the day to day.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>We need those accidental bumpings of atoms to create new kinds of alloys. Oh my goodness. carbon and oxygen linked together. Oh, no, look what happened here. I don&rsquo;t know what they do, I&rsquo;m not a chemist! But my point being is when you&rsquo;re in person and I&rsquo;m going to keep calling them accidents, but not like in a pejorative kind of way, accidents happen, and it allows for very random, unique ideas, conversations, thoughts, whatever to happen, or just even a personal pick me up. Like you do remember me from being on slack for the last year. That&rsquo;s fantastic. There&rsquo;s an affirmation I think that happens for all of us when we&rsquo;re in that kind of proximity with other like-minded people.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:27:21]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think one of the, there&rsquo;s two points about the online events that I seem to keep coming back to. And the first one is that I feel it&rsquo;s taught us that we ought to have hybrid going forward. What I mean by that is that WordCamp EU, I feel it&rsquo;s going to be difficult to put the genie back in the box of you have to go to the place where the event is. I feel that the future is going to be, sure enough, if you want to turn up and you want to benefit from the hallway and all of those things, go for it. But also if you&rsquo;re living halfway around the world, that now needs to be a door which is not closed to you, you need to have it open. There needs to be streaming of those talks that are happening each day so that everybody can take part. That&rsquo;s one of the things that I feel is going to happen.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:28:03]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I completely agree. There are events that I would have never been able to attend on a very regular basis without there being an online component. Someone will solve this puzzle, but I think it&rsquo;s going to be difficult to do a online and in-person event concurrently. I feel that you&rsquo;ll get the worst of both worlds in that case. What I&rsquo;d like to see, let&rsquo;s take WordCamp Europe 2022. There&rsquo;s going to be a three, four day in person spectacle. That&rsquo;s fantastic. What I would like to see is maybe two days before the in-person starts. There&rsquo;s a whole online portion of that. I&rsquo;d be concerned about trying to do them concurrently. Are we really going to have, we can do all the live video for example, but how interactive can we make those live portions? Oh, look from online, we have a question to the speakers. Okay. That works. But outside of those sessions, how are we going to integrate the sponsor hall, the hallway track as we talk about it? Those are those accidents that I like to refer back to just walking up and down and bumping into each other. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an easy problem to solve, but I&rsquo;d love to see some kind of greater online kickoff onboarding experience, where you can meet the speakers, do some quick Q and A&rsquo;s, and conversely, have the speakers say, make sure you don&rsquo;t miss my session on such and such date and time, then that will, of course be also livestreamed.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>It&rsquo;s going to be expensive. It&rsquo;s going to be complicated. And I think there&rsquo;s going to be multiple variations of attempts at making that succeed. I like to go with baby steps to see results. And I think just starting out with maybe a one or two day virtual camp tied to the in-person camp would be a good starter.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:29:46]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>That&rsquo;s what I was meaning really is just basically a camera at the back of the room where there&rsquo;s a presentation going on with the possibility of questions coming, not just from the audience, sat in the auditorium, but from people in a different part of the world. And in fact, I feel it in a way, these kind of like skeuomorphic pieces of software, which tries to replicate the real world, you&rsquo;ve got these AI representations of the hall. It&rsquo;s nice. It&rsquo;s a bit of fun. I feel it&rsquo;s a dead end. Nobody ought to be under the illusion that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;re going to do. But I do like the idea of just, here&rsquo;s the talk, you can watch it at the same time as everybody else. And then maybe you and your pals can hang out. You can do your bit online and we can do our bit in the real world, and so it goes. It&rsquo;s really just an opening up so that you don&rsquo;t have to attend because the problem there would be that nobody actually makes the attempt to attend, but I don&rsquo;t feel that&rsquo;s the case. And my second point is that I feel that we need this stuff back just because the online stuff, there&rsquo;s a fatigue associated with that, and I don&rsquo;t for a minute think that everybody&rsquo;s fatigued and I don&rsquo;t for a minute, think the online events don&rsquo;t have merit because they have enormous merit and they&rsquo;ve been an amazing bridge, but I feel that there&rsquo;s a proportion of the people who would love to be at live events who just can&rsquo;t make the transition to the virtual events. There&rsquo;s something about it. Something stifles them, perhaps they have the best will in the world, and then it&rsquo;s on the screen. But then something in the real world occurs to them. The cat decides to chew up the sofas, so off you go, you&rsquo;ve got to deal with the cat. You get distracted, you want to go and make a cup of tea, so you get distracted. Whereas if you&rsquo;re at the WordCamp, you&rsquo;re fully there. You&rsquo;ve engaged, you&rsquo;ve committed. You&rsquo;ve potentially got on a plane. You&rsquo;ve booked a hotel, all of that. And there&rsquo;s no substitute for that. So that really was my second point is that I want to get the people who&rsquo;ve been disengaged back in and ready to take on all of the challenges that we&rsquo;ve got.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:31:42]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Yeah. I think we&rsquo;re on the same page. I can do virtual events. I certainly prefer in person. And the best example of how we know that in-person is very valuable is when you go to a lot of these virtual events, the networking spaces are generally very empty. People aren&rsquo;t having those conversations, those random accidental conversations that they would add an in-person event because at an in-person event, you are physically, quote unquote, stuck in that space. If you don&rsquo;t want to talk to someone, you&rsquo;re just going to go your own way. That&rsquo;s great. But if you do, who knows who&rsquo;s next to you and you&rsquo;re going to overhear things and interrupt the conversation and be interrupted and that&rsquo;s that magic that occurs.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:32:29]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay. Let&rsquo;s talk about the third point that we wanted to discuss today. I&rsquo;m straying into an area where I don&rsquo;t have a great deal of experience because I watch these things happen from afar. There&rsquo;s nothing that really concerned me. That concerned me in the sense that I might be a consumer of some of the things that are being bought up. But you wanted to talk about, as you described it, the WordPress economy acquisition madness. Now, what did you mean by that? Just kick us off. Explain what you mean by that phrase.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:32:56]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Here&rsquo;s the beauty of being a successful project, people with money will find ways to make money from it. And that&rsquo;s okay, and that&rsquo;s a good thing. We&rsquo;re seeing the likes of Automattic, WP Engine, GoDaddy, Liquid Web, Cloudways, yada, yada, yada. All these companies, wink wink, they&rsquo;re all hosting companies because they&rsquo;ve been in the space for awhile under different platforms and have recurring streams of revenue and cash on hand, they&rsquo;re going to look to grow their businesses, and one of the easiest ways is to find valuable niche projects, that not only will bring cool bit of code into what they&rsquo;re trying to do, but also allow them to reach out to all the people who have installed that plugin.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:33:45]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Do you have concern then that certain parts of the WordPress, let&rsquo;s say plugin or theme space, are going to be consumed by these bigger entities as you described? In many cases, there will be hosting companies for reasons you&rsquo;ve just explained. Do you have a feeling that silos in the future are going to occur? Where if you really want a decent, let&rsquo;s go for, I dunno, membership experience, you really are better off going in the direction of that company, with the brands that it&rsquo;s acquired over time. Or if you want to go for a WooCommerce experience, your best bet is going to be over here, and everything else is a poor relation of that. So we get silos, which we haven&rsquo;t had until now.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:34:28]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I think that&rsquo;ll happen in the short term, but when that happens, a vacuum is created in the overall ecosystem. So if hosting company X has a, quote unquote, monopoly on that membership plugin, you know what, first of all, it&rsquo;s all open source. All it takes is company Y to be like, we want to be in that space as well, and we&rsquo;re going to re-imagine the underlying open source code base in XYZ format. Yes, a lot of letters there, but it&rsquo;ll happen. These kinds of acquisitions and changes in economy I feel are okay. We&rsquo;re all working from an open source code base. If this was all proprietary stuff that you can never take advantage of, I think that would be bad for the community as a whole, but that&rsquo;s not the case. It&rsquo;s just one company saying we&rsquo;re going to be owners of this project. You can still fork that project any day of the week, don&rsquo;t forget. Cause it&rsquo;s all GPL. So I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re losing anything in the long run. There&rsquo;ll be short term hiccups. People won&rsquo;t be happy. If that plugin doesn&rsquo;t do exactly what they want, but they probably wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be happy even if it wasn&rsquo;t taken over by someone else. I think there&rsquo;s a percentage of people that will always want to see all this independent software, but all these companies are technically, okay maybe they&rsquo;re not all independent because some of them are actually listed on public exchanges, but the opportunity hasn&rsquo;t been taken away, and if such and such plugin gets acquired by such and such hosting company, I certainly see another hosting company looking for that competitor also happening.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:36:01]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Do you feel that, okay, again, rewinding the clock for the second time in this podcast, if we could go back maybe 6, 7, 8 years, something like that, before these companies were buying up suites of plugins and what have you, to bulk out their offering. We basically had independent plugin developers. There may have been a team that grew up over time and they were inventing a solution for a particular problem, and they were really invested in that, and that was great. We want to solve the calendar thing or we want to solve the, I don&rsquo;t know, the menu thing, whatever it may be. I&rsquo;m just wondering if we&rsquo;re maybe getting into the territory of designing things to be acquired. We designed something so that this can happen, so that we can become bought up, taken along for the ride by a big hosting company, and just really whether or not there&rsquo;s any dynamic that changes the way that instead of serving the customer and always trying to offer the best support for the product, really your whole intention for that business isn&rsquo;t to create the product for the customer, it&rsquo;s to create the product for the sell in the future.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:37:01]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>I agree. I think there&rsquo;s a potential for that. On the correlator, are you getting value in what you want out of that product? So if I use, there&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;m going to jump into because it&rsquo;s happened recently, but on the face of it, it&rsquo;s a product that is so useful to me that I&rsquo;m not going to have to do custom code. It&rsquo;s above and beyond every other plugin competitor in that space. Am I going to use it? I&rsquo;m going to use it, yes. And to some degree it doesn&rsquo;t really matter what the incentives for the developer are at that point. If it&rsquo;s doing what I wanted to do, that I&rsquo;m going to use it because that&rsquo;s what I needed to do, and it&rsquo;s going to save me 10 50, 200 hours of development time to use this plugin as opposed to trying to create something on my own. And that&rsquo;s question one, or the answer one. Answer two is there certainly is an issue with, what&rsquo;s a nice word for miscreant. I guess it&rsquo;s gonna be miscreant, where we&rsquo;ve seen recently some plugin developers literally switch out what that plugin does and what its value proposition is with, quote unquote, upgrades. And they&rsquo;ve done it behind your back. Oh, well you signed up for this cute little plugin that makes banners, guess what, now it&rsquo;s going to do all these things and you have to pay for it just to get banners again, and it&rsquo;s like really, really is that really what you want to do? And I think those developers are getting called out on it.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>The agencies and content creators, certainly in the nearby community are aware of that. I think those kinds of, yeah, they&rsquo;re not necessarily illegal in any way, shape or form because you can do that, but it doesn&rsquo;t really stick by the unofficial developer third party ecosystem code of conduct. And I think we&rsquo;re always going to see exceptions to the rule, but as long as those are just exceptions, I think we&rsquo;re in a good spot.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:38:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Let&rsquo;s pivot again. Openverse. I&rsquo;ve got to say, this is something that kind of passed me by. The radar wasn&rsquo;t working properly over the last few weeks since Openverse came along. I&rsquo;m going to ask you to tell us what Openverse is. I have a very vague understanding of what it is, but I&rsquo;d like you to tell us why you think it&rsquo;s important.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:39:03]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>This is a new project in the WordPress ecosystem. I should say WordPress dot org ecosystem. It comes from creative commons search project that was languishing at creative commons. They didn&rsquo;t have community and developers interested in pushing the search component along and, with support from Automattic, it came into the welcoming arms of wordpress dot org. And it has it&rsquo;s own thing called Openverse. I&rsquo;m excited by it. One, because it expands the open source vision of WordPress, WordPress becoming even a greater open source proponent. It&rsquo;s not just the CMS, but now we also have additional things that we&rsquo;re caring about, which I think is fantastic. It simultaneously is going to be working on technical aspects as well as open libra software model, or content model, I should say, where the tool will be helping WordPress as well as anyone else, obviously on finding creative commons, open licensed media. So in this case, images. I think it&rsquo;s a great expansion that&rsquo;s completely in line with what the project is looking to do. And I think it&rsquo;s going to be surprisingly helpful and people won&rsquo;t even realize what&rsquo;s going on, but they&rsquo;ll all of a sudden be able to access a bunch of new content natively in whatever application, obviously WordPress will be at that top of the list, but, you&rsquo;ll be able to access it with Drupal or proprietary systems.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:40:40]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What was the problem with the old licensing model? What was broken with it?</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:40:43]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>What was broken was there was no one who was going to commit to keeping up the code base to make CC search working and functioning, tweaking it, bug fixes, whatnot. So, as part of the WordPress project, there will actually be active development and maintenance of the creative common search.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:41:02]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>Okay, so was there any concern that things which you may have downloaded from third-party sites, we all know the ones that we customarily go to, that they were often perhaps changing the license after you downloaded things, and then suddenly you didn&rsquo;t realize that you were in contravention of a license, which you thought you had full access to download, redistribute, do whatever you wanted and suddenly you realize, oh, okay, that&rsquo;s no longer the case. This image that I&rsquo;ve got, I need to take down.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:41:28]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So, licensing is so fun and entertaining. So a lot of these download an image sites, those licenses still stand. So if you have downloaded it and are using an image that was licensed under creative comments, that&rsquo;s not going away. Will they relicense new images? Possibly. The point is how easy will it be to find more creative commons based media? And I think that is the purpose of Openverse, to make that as easy and intuitive as possible. So again, it&rsquo;s taking what used to exist as part of creative, common search, almost like a fork, rebranding it under Openverse and, making it part of an ecosystem that&rsquo;s open source.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-1\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-nathanwrigley vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Nathan Wrigley</cite> [00:42:15]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>And this is going to be completely available inside the WP admin. So you&rsquo;ll have search integrated there, and if you want to search for, I don&rsquo;t know, a cat on cushions, for example, you&rsquo;ll be able to do that and everything that&rsquo;s returned, you&rsquo;ll be able to use, hopefully because the search will have returned something valuable to you in this case cat&rsquo;s on cushions.</p>\n</div></div><div class=\"chat-stanza chat-row chat-speaker-2\"><div class=\"chat-author chat-author-robertjacobi vcard\"><cite class=\"fn\">Robert Jacobi</cite> [00:42:35]</div> <div class=\"chat-text\"><p>So that is my expectation.

Because of this community I have overseas friends.\" /><p>I’m Gobinda Tarafdar from Dhaka, Bangladesh. In short, Gtarafdar. This short form is available everywhere on social media. Actually, while I was a kid, a medicine specialist suggested this short form of my name. From that time, I had a plan to use it. Moving on, now I have become a WordPress Enthusiast Marketer. In this essay, I will share my journey to WordPress with you.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/gtarafdar_winter_clothing.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<h3>Early Stage Of My Career:</h3>\n<p>I started my career as a teacher in an academic coaching center back in 2010. I was then a 1st-year student of my 4-year Graduation Program. But the number of my earnings was not sufficient to cover all my livelihood. My parents were giving me support to continue my study at that time. So I was looking for more ways to earn my living. But in our country, it’s tough to get a job without graduation. I tried to find more tutoring jobs but failed to get one. Then I gave stand-up comedy a try. At that time, it became popular. I participated in a TV reality show based on stand-up comedy. But failed to reach the top five. So, didn’t get much success in the comedy sector as well.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/gtafdar_standup_comedy.jpg\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In this way, two years passed. After a while, I got the idea of a call center job in the telco industry of our country. I gave an interview to our number one telco company Grameenphone &#8211; a sister concern of Telenor. And luckily got the chance to join there. And it’s a game-changing part of my career. I learned a lot about team play, pressure handling, the ability to put myself in a customer’s shoes, and more. But it was a part-time job, and my graduation was about to end. Immediately after finishing my graduation, I got the opportunity to join Grameenphone’s Finance team. However, I had to pass the challenging interview as many other promising candidates were competing with me. Everything seemed so great at that time. Got the opportunity to work in the country&#8217;s best corporate office, but bad luck struck again. Didn’t get the chance to be a full-time employee from contractual employee status.</p>\n<p>I took a break to join the country&#8217;s public service commission. Unfortunately, I failed to get the desired position again. In the meantime, my father retired from his job. All of a sudden, so many responsibilities came upon me. By the way, I forgot to mention, in this time frame, I had completed my Graduation, Masters, and MBA. The year where I’m now in the beginning of 2018. After my father’s retirement, I had no time for an experiment. But the main challenge came then.</p>\n<blockquote><p>No one wanted to give me a chance as I worked at one of Bangladesh&#8217;s most prominent companies; they thought I couldn’t fit into their office culture.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Also, I wanted to start my career as a Digital Marketer, and I had no practical experience at that time. I had some certification of Udemy and Hubspot free courses. But I was confident that I had a degree of MBA in Marketing. But all of my confidence was doomed within three months. I stopped applying everywhere, started to do some research on the job sector. Finally, I decided to join the IT industry, and in our country, WordPress Based companies are in the leading position. So, I had my target fixed towards the WordPress industry.</p>\n<h3>A Huge Risk-Taking State in My Career:</h3>\n<p>I took a huge risk to start my career in the WordPress industry. After not seeing much job opportunities in the Digital Marketing area in my country, I was planning to join the telco industry again as I was finding no option to cherish my dream. I badly needed a job at that time. But meanwhile, I found a job circular in weDevs. They were looking for a Digital Marketer Intern. So I made my decision to take part in this program. Surprisingly, I got another job offer from a renowned MNC of our country in the sales team. But I took a huge risk and started trying for the weDevs internship program, and refused the salesperson job. My friends <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrMayeen\">Mayeen</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AkhterArif\">Arif</a> helped me a lot to learn more about WordPress. And they guided me on how I could set up localhost on my computer, and from then, I started to explore themes and plugins from the WordPress repository. I must say I got an interesting tool to play with. After passing three stages, I finally got the chance to join weDevs. weDevs is a popular WordPress Plugin making company. It’s famous for Dokan Multivendor Marketplace Solution for WooCommerce.</p>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gtarafdar_life_at_weDevs.jpg\"><img /></a>My Life at weDevs\n<p>Ohh, maybe you have a question about how it can be risky to go for the weDevs internship program! Well, the payout of the other company was three times higher than the weDevs internship payout. And I refused to join the other sales team while I still didn’t have any guarantee to join the weDevs team. So now you can judge, isn’t that risky? (Sorry, I can’t share the name of the sales company publicly here due to some policy issue.)</p>\n<h3>The Journey to WordPress:</h3>\n<p>From the day when I had installed WordPress in my local host, my journey in this ecosystem started. I found it so easy to use and user-friendly that I felt anyone could create a website. I started to read articles and explore the World of WordPress. Also, weDevs’s internship program helped me a lot to get involved in the WordPress industry. My mentor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AfshanaDiya\">Afshana Diya</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mainul0aion\">Mainul Kabir Aion</a> guided me a lot to dive deep into the sea of WordPress. Learned the area of content marketing, explored paid mediums, gathered knowledge on social media marketing, and more within three months. The internship program was exact and compact, along with interactive.</p>\n<p>Here came another twist. I wanted to be a part of the Digital Marketing Team. But because of my communication skills and interpersonal relationship skills, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nizam5428\">Mr. Nizam Uddin</a> (Founder &amp; CEO at weDevs) offered me the Business Development executive position. It was an entirely new thing at weDevs. I was the one-man army in the Business Development Team. And it opened up a new world to me. At that time, I got my first chance to attend a WordCamp (WCAhmedabad, India 2018). From that time, I got the motive to be involved in the WordPress Community. I’ll share how WordCamps can help you to join the community closely. Later on, I got the chance to participate in WordCamp Kolkata 2019, WordCamp Nagpur 2019. It was a fantastic journey to join WordCamps in person. In 2019 I took part in WordCamp Dhaka as a volunteer.</p>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gtarafdar_WordCamps.jpg\"><img /></a>My Journey to WordCamps\n<p>I’d love to share with you; now, I have become part of the Digital Marketing Team of weDevs. After almost two years of my journey as a business development executive, I got this new opportunity to prove myself again. So I took this opportunity and became a Digital Strategist.</p>\n<p>Now I’m dedicatedly taking care of a sole product. It’s an Addon of Elementor Page Builder. It’s HappyAddons for Elementor. I’m the product coordinator of this excellent tool. From zero to now, 100k+ users are actively using this tool. It’s an incredible learning period in my career path. I learned how to grow a product from the ground level. It’s a great achievement for me as a Product Marketer.</p>\n<h3>How WordCamp Helps Me to Become a Member in the WordPress Community:</h3>\n<p>WordCamps are the place of like-minded people. When you are in touch with the right people under the same roof, you will get that homely feeling. Also, in WordCamps, you get to meet industry experts. Interestingly, you can collect lucrative swag items. To some extent, you will get an opportunity to make partnerships to expand the business. Moreover, some companies share job boxes where anyone can share their resume. So it could be a place of opportunities. Who knows what you will get. But in my case, I made so many friends. We are now close buddies.</p>\n<p>The exciting part, some WordCamps run contributors day. On that day, you will get the chance to know closely about how you can take part in the core programs of WordPress. From WordCamp Ahmedabad, I started participating in WordPress programs, also started joining WordPress teams meetings. I’ve become active on social media as well to spread news and updates related to WordPress.</p>\n<h3 id=\"enriching\">How I’m Enriching My Knowledge of WordPress:</h3>\n<p>One line changes my way of thinking. Once I was talking with our Founder &amp; CTO, Mr. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tareq_cse\">Tareq Hasan</a>, regarding this topic. He just said, “Gobinda, you don’t have to learn coding to solve the problems of WordPress; you have to gain the ability to solve the problem by anyhow. You can solve any kind of problem by referring to other WordPress Plugins and tools.”</p>\n<p>I got a new meaning of using WordPress. From that time, I have started to check WordPress plugins and themes to learn more about their purpose. WordPress repository now becomes a place of amusement for me. Sometimes, my colleagues refer to me as a ‘plugin man’ as I try to give a quick solution to WordPress-related problems with the help of WordPress plugins.</p>\n<p>Still, I’m participating in several Facebook Group discussions. Trying to solve several solutions and learning what problems are usually people facing while creating websites with WordPress. And believe me, there is definitely a solution to each particular problem.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You have to keep patience and search for the solution in the right type of keywords.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For example, yesterday on the Facebook group &#8211; WordPressian (Dedicated Facebook Group for those who speak Bangali), a person was looking to create a courier service platform where people can track their package. Most people suggested building a custom-made solution. But I know there is a solution; I randomly found it on the WP repository.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I just googled this term “WordPress plugin: courier service”. Google didn’t disappoint me.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I got my answer, read the description, reviewed, checked screenshots, and shared the solution with that person.</p>\n<p>To increase my knowledge of WordPress, I use another method. I use some Google Chrome Extensions for checking the Builtwith Materials of WordPress sites. When I jump on a WordPress site, I just click on the Chrome Ext. and check the plugins they’ve used to create their site. And it helps me a lot to learn the tools and their purposes. You can do that if you want to increase your knowledge of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Lastly, you have to create a site by yourself. Otherwise, you would not be able to know the issue on your own. At least create your own portfolio site. I have learned so many things while creating my portfolio site: gtarafdar.com. You will know some untold facts, and finally, you will get a boost. <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/retiring-young-bangladesh-thanks-wordpress/\">Mr. Asif Rahman</a>, the founder of WP Developers, gave me this idea. He always inspires me to create a personal website. Also, he forced me to write about WordPress daily. Guided me on how I can create a site with Elementor in 2018. I became familiar with a handy tool that helps me create a site without having coding experiences from that time. Later on, it helped me to take over the Happy Elementor Addons Project.</p>\n<h3>How you can connect with WordPress Socially:</h3>\n<p>Twitter is the best medium. I opened my Twitter account in 2010. But I had no motivation to use it as I didn’t have people close to me there. My friends were all on Facebook. I was also trying to involve myself on Facebook. But after joining weDevs, I found my Mentor, Afshana Diya, was so active on Twitter, and she has so many like-minded people on Twitter, and most of them belong to the WordPress community. I got new motivation to use Twitter. I started to connect with WordPress Professionals. Also interacted with them regularly. And I must say it feels really amazing.</p>\n<p>I’ve prepared a Twitter<a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/lists/1143525711489036288\"> list of WordPress Influencers</a>. You can easily follow them from here.</p>\n<h3>How you can start your career at WordPress:</h3>\n<p>If you have a passion for coding, you could be a WordPress developer. In our region, here is a myth. To become a developer, you have to be a CSE grad. But it’s not true. Let’s check a fact. In our weDevs, most of the Developers are directly not from Computer Science Engineering backgrounds. In the same way, you may have joined the CSE program at an early stage, but now you may not have that much passion for coding. You can be a Product Manager. In the WordPress industry, there is scope for a Product manager as well. Another exciting sector is the Quality Assurance team. So many companies are hiring in this sector. Moreover, if you like to communicate with people, you can join the Support Engineering team. You can’t imagine how many job openings there are in the support engineering field.</p>\n<p>Those who don’t have any coding knowledge but are proficient in English and have a passion for writing can join as Content Marketers. There are plenty of job vacancies in the content marketing area.</p>\n<p>Another interesting option is joining the Designing team. If you find interest in the designing sector and love to play with the designing tools like Figma, Adobe Tools, Sketch, you can definitely join the design team of a WordPress company.</p>\n<p>Later on, other job sectors like HR management, Accounts, Business Development, and other necessary areas are also available on WordPress companies. More interestingly, you can work remotely in so many companies. WordPress founding company Automattic is running its whole operation remotely. You just have to find your perfect niche. Otherwise, you can be frustrated.</p>\n<p>I’ve prepared a list of <a href=\"https://gtarafdar.com/wpjobs/popular-wordpress-companies-to-apply-for-jobs/\">WordPress companies</a> where you can apply for jobs.</p>\n<p>Finally, don’t be frustrated, my mate. I often hear from my fellow friends and juniors always blame God, parents, and the government because of their unemployment problem. But when I reach them and personally request to gain some technical skills, they just run away most of the time. Not even reply to my messages anymore. Even some of them block me. Lol. Also, some other groups are available; they knock me for jobs and share their family issues, but when I ask them to learn more about web development, they just fly like a bat. I don’t know what their problem is. If you are in the same category, then my mate, you are in huge trouble. Change your mindset. Gain some skills. It could be anything. Try one by one. Then choose the best one for you. But again, don’t be frustrated. Keep focusing on your goal. And dive into it.</p>\n<h3>What’s The Challenge on Working in WordPress Industry:</h3>\n<p>I’ve shared all the positive things about joining the WordPress industry. But there is a significant challenge you have to face while you will join the community. In my region, very few people know WordPress. Only tech-savvy people are familiar with that. Even most of the people don’t have any prior knowledge about remote job life. I have personally experienced so many funny incidents. Last year when my family members found me in front of my Mac and sometimes talking with some people, sometimes in English, they found me as an alien in my house. Even most of the time, I failed to give proof of how the whole work was done. You will face the same situation if you belong to the rural area of Bangladesh. But don’t worry, I prepared a comic book on <a href=\"https://gtarafdar.com/book/e-book-describe-wordpress-to-non-techies/\">Describe WordPress To Non-Techies</a>. You can read the conversation with my Grandpa. I have tried to give an idea about WordPress. I hope this will help you to introduce WordPress to the non-tech guys.</p>\n<h3>How I’m Contributing to the WordPress Community and how you can start:</h3>\n<p>Usually, I try to attend the weekly meeting of WordPress teams. I have attended several coffee-talk sessions of WordPress Teams. It helps me join with the members. Also, I’m trying to contribute to the Polyglot team. I have started to give suggestions of translating WordPress in Bangla. But mostly, I contribute in different ways. I have conducted local WordPress meet-ups, volunteered on WordCamps. I spread the news and updates through my social media accounts. Help WordPress people to find jobs. Recently, I’ve started my YouTube Channel(Gtarafdarr). I have begun to create how-to tutorials on WordPress.</p>\n<p>If you want to join WordPress core teams, you will need a WordPress Slack Account. From here, you can join WordPress <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Slack</a>.</p>\n<p>From here, you will find the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meetings/\">meeting</a> schedules of different teams. Don’t get puzzled. You can sort out your desired teams and add the meeting reminders to your calendar.</p>\n<p>Everyone in the WordPress community is so helpful. If you find any difficulties, raise your hand and people will guide you in the right way.</p>\n<p>Also, there are so many WordPress Facebook communities. Some are locals, and few are international, like WordPress, Advanced WordPress, WordPress For Non-Techies by WPCrafter, The WP Admin Bar, WPLeague, WPBeginner Engage &#8211; WordPress Help for Non-Techies, etc. Local Communities are, WordPressians, Kolkata WordPress Community (WPKolkata), etc. You can join these groups to get help from experts. Also, you can help others if you know the answers of the queries.</p>\n<h3>This How WordPress Changed My Life</h3>\n<p>Finally, I’m really thankful to WordPress. Because of this community I have overseas friends. We talk and meet virtually. All of them are so helpful. I get new motivations to do something extraordinary in my daily routine. I’m thankful to my parents and my younger sister as they rely upon me. They help me to take the risk to chess my dream. I’m grateful to weDevs and Tareq Hasan, Nizam Uddin, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Asif2BD\">Asif Rahman</a>, Afshana Diya, Mainul Kabir Aion, and my friends Arif, Mayeen, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/shahriar_na\">Shahriar</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reachmazharul\">Mazhar</a>, and so on. They all have played a significant role in helping me become Gtarafdar, a WordPress enthusiast. Also, thanks to the HeroPress team for reaching me and encouraging me to share my story here.</p>\n<p>I’m still learning about WordPress and have to go further. If you want to connect with me, you can follow me on Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Gtarafdarr\">@Gtarafdarr</a>. Let’s contribute to WordPress and hold the glory of the supreme power of an open-source platform.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/how-wordpress-has-changed-my-life-gtarafdar/\">How WordPress Has Changed My Life &#8211; Gtarafdar</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 06:42:10 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16:\"Gobinda Tarafdar\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"WPTavern: InstaWP Launches New Service for Disposable WordPress Testing Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119740\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:199:\"https://wptavern.com/instawp-launches-new-service-for-disposable-wordpress-testing-sites?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=instawp-launches-new-service-for-disposable-wordpress-testing-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4526:\"<p>Competition in the sandboxing products space is heating with the entrance of <a href=\"https://instawp.io/\">InstaWP</a>, a new service for setting up disposable WordPress testing sites. Founder Vikas Singhal created the tool to provide a quick way to set up live testing sites online or to show something to a client or team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP joins the ranks of services like <a href=\"https://tastewp.com/\">TasteWP</a> and <a href=\"https://wpsandbox.io/\">WPSandbox</a> but with a few unique options. At setup, users can select from WordPress versions back to 4.7 and may even choose to spin up a site using the latest beta or release candidate. Like other services, InstaWP allows you to choose your PHP version. The ability to disable WP cache and browser cache is coming soon. Users can create a custom name for their sites or leave it blank for a randomly generated name.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Free WordPress instances stay live for 8 hours, and users can link their accounts via email to extend it to 48 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP, not to be confused with <a href=\"https://instantwp.com/\">InstantWP</a>, a local WordPress installation tool, was built on an nginx + Apache server without any containers. Singhal said he found containers to be too heavy for this particular use case. He runs a <a href=\"https://expresstech.io/\">WordPress plugin/theme shop</a> along with an&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://justhyre.com/\">agency</a>&nbsp;on the side, both of which could benefit from InstaWP&rsquo;s quick testing sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I wanted to build a solution for ourselves where we can quickly launch WP instances for a variety of reasons &ndash; testing a feature of WP, testing a plugin/theme, testing in different versions of WP/PHP and last but not the least &ndash; creating an &lsquo;instant&rsquo; test environment for the clients for them to test our plugins/themes,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal started InstaWP a month ago and received so much positive feedback on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/Wordpress/comments/o8cxwj/instawp_launch_a_disposable_wp_instantly_free/\">Reddit</a> and from the <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/poststatus/453?e=de2e3e61f2\">Post Status community</a> that he hired two dedicated developers to work on the project. Testers have commented on how fast the service spins up sites. Version <a href=\"http://next.expresstech.io/instawp/updates/939abf2f-c532-4abc-b701-eec9f89b6fda\">1.1.0</a> introduced Slack integration, which allows users to instantly set up a site by typing /wp in Slack. The release also added WordPress admin auto login for quick access without username and password.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP has a <a href=\"https://next.expresstech.io/instawp\">public road map</a>. Features on deck for future releases include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>Slack and cli commands</li><li>Download Files and DB Backup from the UI</li><li>Direct push to FTP or cPanel</li><li>nginx and nginx + Apache configurations</li><li>Finer controls on PHP settings</li><li>Save configurations for instant launch of pre-configured WP</li><li>Integrations with hosting providers</li><li>Map custom domains</li><li>Multiple servers around the world (USA, Singapore, London, etc.)</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal said he was aware of TasteWP as a competitor but plans to differentiate InstaWP based on simplicity and feature set. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;My vision with InstaWP is make it a default tool for WP learners, enthusiasts, freelancers, and agencies &ndash; basically everyone,&rdquo; he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal plans to monetize the tool for both end-users and plugin and theme authors. Users will have to upgrade to gain access to increased limits, custom domains, FTP access, and the ability to reserve a site. WordPress product authors can upgrade to provide 1-click demos to their clients and prospective customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Singhal said so far more than 500 instances have been created and teams from Yoast and some agencies are already using the tool. Several prominent WordPress businesses have requested agency pricing that would allow their users to test their plugins via a 1-click preconfigured install. The service is still under active development and Singhal plans to iron out pricing in the near future. Testers who have suggestions for InstaWP can log them on the tool&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://next.expresstech.io/instawp#/ideas\">idea board</a> for future consideration.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 04:25:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"WPTavern: Duotone Filters: WordPress 5.8 Puts a Powerful Image-Editing Tool Into Users’ Hands\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119885\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:227:\"https://wptavern.com/duotone-filters-wordpress-5-8-puts-a-powerful-image-editing-tool-into-users-hands?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=duotone-filters-wordpress-5-8-puts-a-powerful-image-editing-tool-into-users-hands\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4769:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Features such as the upcoming <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\">block-based widgets system</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">the template editor</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/query-loop-the-ins-and-outs-of-one-of-wordpress-5-8s-most-powerful-features\">theme-related blocks</a>, and others have taken up much of the spotlight as of late. However, one of the best user-focused tools shipping with WordPress 5.8 is a duotone filter for Image and Cover blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;duotone&rdquo; in this sense means combining two colors as a filter. Then, layering it over an image or video. More specifically, one color is used for the shadows (dark elements), and the second color is used for the highlights (light colors).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the feature first <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-6-adds-duotone-filters-query-pattern-carousel-and-most-used-tags-selector\">landed in Gutenberg 10.6</a> back in May, I spent a couple of hours just tinkering around with it on that first day. Since then, I have racked up a few more. It is a powerful media-editing tool that does not require users to dive into image-editing programs, allowing them to change the mood of a story at the click of a button.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotones can be anything from a simple grayscale to a mixture of any two colors. Shadows and highlights can even be inverted, depending on the shades chosen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following shows the difference between an original image of kittens (<em>because who doesn&rsquo;t love kittens?</em>) and one with a grayscale filter:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"juxtapose\"><img id=\"119947\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kittens-orig.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1792\" height=\"1008\" class=\"image-compare__image-before\" /><img id=\"119948\" src=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/kittens-gray.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1793\" height=\"1008\" class=\"image-compare__image-after\" /></div>Original image vs. grayscale duotone version.\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress offers a set of eight duotone color sets by default. This includes a grayscale, dark grayscale, and various combinations, making for some fun filters. Some will work better than others, often depending on the media file uploaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Applying the WordPress purple and yellow duotone filter.\n\n\n\n<p>Like many other features awaiting users with WordPress 5.8, theme authors are those who need to dig in to offer a range of ready-baked options for users. The new <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/fse-outreach-round-8-a-developer-centric-call-for-testing-theme-json-configuration\">theme JSON file configuration</a> allows developers to define a set of duotone colors that match their theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defining custom duotone filters is as easy as plugging a name, a slug, and two colors into a <code>theme.json</code> file. The theme developer handbook includes <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/#presets\">examples of creating such presets</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom &ldquo;emerald scale&rdquo; duotone filter from a theme.\n\n\n\n<p>Users are not limited to the filters that WordPress or their themes offer. The duotone popover allows them to choose from any range of colors for custom shadows and highlights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotone typically works best when an image has a high contrast, which means a wide-ranging spread between the light and dark colors. Darker shadows and lighter highlights make for more visually stunning filters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When used with the Cover block, users can add filters to both image and video backgrounds. However, they also have access to the typical overlay color or gradient option. This provides a ton of flexibility for customizing media.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Duotone filter + gradient overlay on a Cover block.\n\n\n\n<p>Because the duotone feature works with an inline SVG file under the hood, it also means that using it does not permanently change image or video files. Users can still use their original media elsewhere on the site without uploading a second copy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Duotone is just the tip of the iceberg.

The company advocates for open source software, open source hardware, and open data, while providing a central point of collaboration for people working in the open sectors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The State of the Open report offers a broad overview of the UK&rsquo;s open source ecosystem. This collection of research includes surveys of UK companies, interviews, industry reports, and analysis from different publications. It was sponsored by GitHub, SUSE, and the Open Invention Network, and conducted by <a href=\"http://smoothmedia.com/\">Smoothmedia</a> consulting firm under the direction of ethnographer and social researcher Dr. Jennifer Barth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key findings in <a href=\"https://openuk.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/openuk_stateofope2021_report_FINALCHANGES_08.pdf\">Phase 1</a> of the report include research demonstrating that open source software contributes an estimated &pound;43.1 billion to the UK economy, with the UK ringing in as Europe&rsquo;s largest contributor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openuk.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/State-of-Open-Phase-Two.pdf\">Phase 2</a> covers open source adoption in the UK. Researchers found a staggering 97% of the 273 UK businesses surveyed use some form of open source software:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>We found that 97% of businesses of different sizes in all sectors of the UK economy use open source software technology. Although resources became a more pressing concern during the pandemic, 64% of businesses in our sample experienced business growth which translated into a high recruitment drive for roles relating to open source software in the past 12 months (see recruitment findings). Further, we find that almost half of businesses surveyed (48%) are using open source software more as digital adoption becomes embedded in organisational culture and business.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Other key findings from Phase 2 include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>53% of non-tech organizations contribute to open source software projects</li><li>77% of UK public sector looks to open source for skills developmen </li><li>Over half (54%) have written policies and processes for open source contributions</li><li>89% run open source software internally in their business</li><li>Approximately two thirds (65%) contribute to open source software projects</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>One interesting observation from the contribution data is that smaller companies are more likely to contribute back to open source than larger companies. Smaller companies are also more likely to use open source software in their businesses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">From the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/StateOfOpen?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#StateOfOpen</a> report from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/openuk_uk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@openuk_uk</a>, it\'s clear that businesses of all sizes make key use of open source.

This report will focus on UK data with a methodology tailored to reveal the value of open source software to the digital economy. It will also include case studies that demonstrate the non-economic, intangible benefits of open source software, such as skills development and collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The published <a href=\"https://openuk.uk/stateofopen/\">reports</a> are lengthy but will be of particular interest to companies working in the UK and Europe, especially consultancies that may need to justify using open source technologies in engineering decisions.

Taking a weekend-afternoon deep dive into creating custom block types meant learning some tough lessons and familiarizing myself with a programming language I had little experience using.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Programming has always been a trial-and-error affair for me: write code, refresh the browser, read the error message, and attempt to fix the problem. Then, simply rinse and repeat the process until the program is not broken. Those mistakes are woven into the art of coding, the layers underneath that poetry on the visible canvas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have absolutely made the same mistake twice. And, thrice. Probably a lot more than that if I am being honest with myself and you. Eventually, I stop making those same mistakes, and some method or procedure is permanently seared into my brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have written a few hundred WordPress tutorials in the past decade and a half. I am a twice-published author of development books and served as a tech editor on another. However, I am not much of a reader of tech books and documentation. For one, programmers are not necessarily the most engaging writers. Plus, <em>book smarts</em> can only get you so far. You need the <em>street smarts</em> of programming to become good at it, which means learning from experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While I firmly believe that reading is a central part of that, there is no replacement for getting your hands dirty. Building things, making mistakes, and learning to fix them is what makes programming fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working on open-source software like WordPress is one of the best ways to do that. There is no upfront cost, assuming you have access to a computer, a prerequisite to programming of any kind. There are usually people willing to lend a hand or answer questions, and there are always problems to solve for those ready to dive into them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress Executive Director <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/the-commons-of-images/\">Josepha Haden Chomphosy chatted with Matt Mullenweg</a> on the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/openverse-why-this-project-is-good-for-wordpress-and-the-web\">Openverse project</a> a couple of months ago, there was a moment that I found myself nodding my head in agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Because, of course, you know, contributing and being involved with open source is probably the best way to learn a technology, better than any college degree.</p><cite><em>Matt Mullenweg, WordPress Project Lead</em></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I have learned more about WordPress, PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by contributing to open-source software than I ever learned in a college course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I grew up in a generation that was told that we must get a college degree. It was an integral part of the American dream that would result in suburban life in a neighborhood with perfectly aligned rows of houses, ending in a cul-de-sac. It was the first step toward a two-car garage, white-picket-fence, 2.5 kids, and a dog. College was the promise that my peers and I hinged everything on. It was expected of us, and so many of us did our duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the thing that our parents did not know. The internet would change everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I graduated high school in 2002. This was during that stretch where the online world was exploding. All of the world&rsquo;s knowledge would soon be at our fingertips. Today that is truer than ever. Anything you will ever need to learn about writing code is available through an internet connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My experience with college-level courses in programming was mixed, but I learned a necessary life lesson from them: I was not cut out for a degree in software engineering. I am glad I wised up early on and pursued a different degree, saving myself some time and money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rocked my half-summer C programming class, my introduction to writing code. I also had a passionate professor who once worked on U.S. missile projects as a bug-tester. It was probably not the most glamorous job, but he always made it sound exciting because he loved what he was doing. Our class was tasked with building various programs throughout the course, but we usually had a choice in what we were building. For my group&rsquo;s final project, we created vending machine software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was on the fast track to becoming a software engineer after that first class. I had built a way for merchants to get paid for delivering sugary treats and soft drinks to customers. It was capitalism meeting programming, and I had a taste for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fall semester rolled around, and I was motivated to move beyond the realm of procedural programming in C. Java, an object-oriented programming (OOP) language, would be my next challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most advanced thing our class built for an entire semester was a basic calculator. I skipped nearly every lecture because I could not stay awake watching the professor chicken-peck his way through programs for three hours every week. I attended the mandatory &ldquo;labs&rdquo; &mdash; basically a fancy way of saying an extra class where the professor&rsquo;s assistants would teach the actual coursework. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Needless to say, my fire died down. While calculator programs are handy tools, I wanted to branch out and build things that mattered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>You know what reignited my flame for programming?</em> At first, it was general web development. But, WordPress was what I really became passionate about. And, I have not looked back since I started using it in 2005.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress was my gateway into a world where I could create things that interested me. I could jump ahead into a project far more advanced than my skill level, trial-and-error my way ahead, and eventually build something that others found value in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless universities have changed, most teach step-by-step foundational lessons to their pupils. Some students may luck out and land in that unique professor&rsquo;s class who gives them leeway to explore various ideas. However, there is no substitute for creating something of your own, solving a problem that you see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, that is what programming is all about &mdash; solving problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2007, I released my first WordPress plugin into the wild. It automatically listed all of the subpages of the currently-viewed page. Dozens of similar plugins have been written since and probably before (<em>it seems WordPress would have a simple &ldquo;list subpages&rdquo; function by now</em>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week, after writing a new plugin, I was reminded of the free education that the WordPress community has given me over the years. Some of it has been reading documentation. Some from WordPress Stack Exchange answers. Other bits have been studying from those who came before me, building upon their open-source code. All of it was from other people giving something back to our community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not necessarily a knock on college.  Some people perform better in that structured environment, and there is value in all forms of education. However, there are alternatives for those who cannot afford college or learn better in a different environment.  And, there is no discounting the experience you get from contributing to something bigger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are one of our readers thinking about getting into programming, just dive in. Make some mistakes.

July 20th is only 10 days away. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/wordpress-5-8-release-candidate-2/\"><strong>WordPress 5.8 RC 2</strong></a> is out and could use your eagle eyes to spot last-minute bugs and quirks. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What else has happened in the WordPress Gutenberg space last week? I have a few more links for you. As always, you don&#8217;t have to consume them all in one sitting, you can always come back during the week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wishing you a wonderful weekend and start into your next week!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours, 💕<br />Birgit</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gutenberg Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/07/09/whats-new-in-gutenberg-11-0-0-9-july/\"><strong>Gutenberg 11.0 was released</strong></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/get_dave\">Dave Smith</a></strong> compiled the release notes for the team.

You can change the layout for post title, featured image, excerpt and link.  An early version of this was the Latest Post Block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design team also implemented a series of Block Patterns of a few nice variations to display a post list on templates, post and pages. It&#8217;s a fun feature, and it has taken quite a long time to build. The wait was definitely worth it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is mighty and could be the most powerful feature in 5.8 as <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> headlined his post <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/query-loop-the-ins-and-outs-of-one-of-wordpress-5-8s-most-powerful-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Query Loop: The Ins and Outs</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Allison Rivers</strong> over the Torque Magazine also published an article <a href=\"https://torquemag.io/2021/07/what-is-wordpress-5-8s-query-loop-block/\"><strong>What is the Query Loop Block?</strong></a> with lots of great insights and examples. Rivers also has a list of plugins that implemented some advanced features the WordPress version is still missing with its first iteration. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Building and Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Reading throught the release notes for Gutenberg 11, I found great gem posted by <strong>Riad Benguella</strong>.

The release is geared up to be the most feature-packed update the community has seen in a while. <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\">Block-based widgets</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-beta-1-released-new-blocks-new-widgets-screen-and-pattern-directory-on-deck\">the pattern directory</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-introduces-support-for-webp-images\">WebP image support</a>, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">template-editing mode</a>, and many more tools are nearly ready to ship to the masses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, one of the most powerful features is the Query Loop block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are unfamiliar with the terms &ldquo;Query&rdquo; and &ldquo;Loop,&rdquo; they are vital concepts within WordPress. Traditionally, they were only necessary for theme and plugin development. However, through the Query Loop block, users will gain exposure to what is, for all intents and purposes, the backbone of how WordPress displays posts on a site&rsquo;s front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Queries? Loops?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Not everyone will be immediately familiar with these developer terms that WordPress is plopping down in the user interface. For theme and plugin authors, these are everyday concepts. However, even some users who have been using the platform for a decade have never been exposed to them. So, we should get some basic definitions in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The term &ldquo;Query&rdquo; is simpler than you might think. It merely means to &ldquo;query&rdquo; or &ldquo;ask&rdquo; for posts from the database according to a defined set of options. For example, one might attempt to get the last 10 blog posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Loop&rdquo; is an even easier concept to grasp. It means to &ldquo;loop&rdquo; or &ldquo;cycle&rdquo; through each queried post and output it. Technically, a developer could do things other than displaying the posts during this process, but we are only concerned with what gets printed on the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two things combined become the Query Loop block. It allows users to ask for a set of posts and display each one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a Post Template block, which throws a wrinkle in all of this. Aside from the word &ldquo;template&rdquo; being overused in WordPress for various features, this is a new method for an old concept. Traditionally, WordPress theme authors would write out all the HTML and call specific template tags within the queried posts loop to show things like the post title, author, content, and more. This is easy to do within a PHP file. However, in the block editor, there needed to be a new way to group these things together. The Post Template block acts as this group, housing the things users want to display in the Query Loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress also has a variation on the Query Loop block called Posts List. They do the same thing, but the latter has a more user-friendly title than the former. The only problem with this variation is that, when it is inserted, the user still sees the same &ldquo;Query Loop&rdquo; block title. There is a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32268\">ticket to fix this</a>, but it is unlikely to make it into WordPress 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Query Loop Pattern Inserter</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When first inserting a Query Loop into the editor, WordPress will introduce users to another version 5.8 feature: the pattern inserter. Instead of having immediate access to interact with the block, users can select from a list of predefined patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default, the inserter is a carousel that lets users can scroll through patterns individually:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop pattern inserter: carousel view.\n\n\n\n<p>However, they can switch to a grid-based layout and view all of the patterns at once:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop pattern inserter: grid view.\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 is set to ship with six Query Loop patterns by default, unless more are added in the coming days:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Standard</li><li>Image at left</li><li>Small image and title</li><li>Grid</li><li>Large title</li><li>Offset</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not particularly fond of any of the default patterns other than the &ldquo;Large title&rdquo; one (shown in the screenshots above with the black background and white text). For this block to shine, users will need to build out their own designs or wait for theme authors to begin bundling custom Query Loop patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, that is how it should be. Core WordPress should ship some basics while letting our community of theme designers showcase their craft.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />A custom simple blog posts listing.\n\n\n\n<p>This is also an opportunity for theme authors to offer alternatives to their custom page template designs. It is not time to throw them out entirely. However, it is a way to begin recreating old ideas in the block era, such as building out eCommerce plugin integrations, portfolio grids, and much more. Some of the tools are still limited (we are getting to those next), but there is enough initial groundwork for exploration, helping users experience WordPress in new ways.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The Query Loop block has several options for users to customize which posts to <em>query</em> the database for:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Query Loop block and its options.\n\n\n\n<p>In the block toolbar, there is a &ldquo;Display settings&rdquo; button. When clicked, it creates a popover with options for how many posts to show:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Items per Page:</strong> Number of posts to display per page</li><li><strong>Offset:</strong> Number of posts to skip over</li><li><strong>Max page to show:</strong> Limit pages (this requires using one of the Query Pagination blocks)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The &ldquo;Settings&rdquo; panel in the Query Loop&rsquo;s block sidebar has several secondary options. Users can enable &ldquo;Inherit query from template&rdquo; to use WordPress&rsquo;s global query, but this is mostly useless for WordPress 5.8 users without the Gutenberg plugin enabled and a block-based theme. For now, you will almost always want to disable this option. This will grant access to a slew of new choices, such as:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Post type</li><li>Ordering</li><li>Filters panel for categories, tags, author, and keyword</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The Settings and Filters panels are the most fine-tuned pieces of the Query Loop block. The development team struck a sensible balance between ease-of-use and the dozens of query-related parameters available through code. It provides users with a ton of power right of the gate but should be flexible enough in the future for plugin authors to extend.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Post Template</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">When inserting a Query Loop, the editor automatically adds its inner Post Template block. This is where most of the magic happens. Users can directly change how their posts appear. Primarily, they will do so by adding blocks from the Theme category, many of which are for outputting post-related data.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Theme-categorized blocks for outputting dynamic data.\n\n\n\n<p>Nearly all other blocks are available for insertion here too. However, many of them will not be great candidates for use within the Query Loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that may not be immediately evident is that changes you make to one post within the Post Template block will affect all others. So, if you add a Video or Buttons block here, they will be identical. Remember, this is a &ldquo;template&rdquo; for designing how all posts within the Query Loop will appear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The drawback for customizing the Post Template block output is the lack of design options for some of the blocks. It is easy to build something like a simple post list:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Posts list with titles and dates.\n\n\n\n<p>You can also build a layout like a portfolio project grid, as shown in the following screenshot. However, the Post Featured Image block does not currently have sizing controls, so you are stuck with your theme&rsquo;s default post-thumbnail size &mdash; assuming it is actually registered. <em>Experiences may vary.

The Download button <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210106091723/https://wordpress.org/download/\">used to be at the top of the Download page</a> but ever since mid-January 2021, it has been pushed further down below recommended hosts. This is presumably to help people who want to set up a self-hosted site but don&rsquo;t know where to get started.  </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Google was skipping our defined page descriptions in favor of some in-page content,&rdquo; WordPress lead developer Dion Hulse <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dd32/status/1413325529223073798\">said</a>, regarding the issue with the search results snippet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Meta team was alerted to the problem and quickly put a solution in place to encourage Google to look somewhere else on the page for the main content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Download page has info about the mobile apps and hosting for WordPress,&rdquo; core contributor Corey McKrill wrote in the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/11108\">commit message</a>. &ldquo;These are in&nbsp;<code>section</code>&nbsp;container elements, which might be the reason that Google is using the content of the hosting container for its search result snippet, instead of the meta description tag.

The Meta team acted swiftly to resolve the issue and return the snippet to its former meta description. It is not known how long Google has been pulling from the text in the recommended hosts sections to populate the snippet, but the code is now more explicit about the fact that those companies are not the most important content on the Download page.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 02:05:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:42:\"WPTavern: Awesome Motive Acquires SearchWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119714\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:129:\"https://wptavern.com/awesome-motive-acquires-searchwp?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=awesome-motive-acquires-searchwp\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4345:\"<p>Awesome Motive, the company behind <a href=\"https://www.monsterinsights.com/\">MonsterInsights</a>, <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/\">OptinMonster</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\">WPForms</a>, and several other popular products, has acquired <a href=\"https://searchwp.com/\">SearchWP</a>, a commercial plugin that enhances WordPress&rsquo; search functionality. No changes have been announced for the plugin and Awesome Motive CEO Syed Balkhi says it will be &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; for current customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We have built a lot of internal tools to improve our website search that I&rsquo;m really looking forward to sharing with the WordPress community,&rdquo; Balkhi said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We will be combining Jon&rsquo;s vision with our own experience, so you can literally have the best search plugin in the industry without the high costs.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013, when Jon Christopher launched SearchWP, he quickly carved out a slice of the WordPress search market among early competitors. The freemium model was already popular in those days with plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/\">Relevanssi</a>, but Christopher chose to launch SearchWP as a commercial-only product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There was already freemium competition, and I felt that the pricing model (which is the same today) was stronger given the product itself,&rdquo; Christopher said. &ldquo;I saw the pricing model as something that would help SearchWP stand out, and I also wanted to avoid opening the doors to overwhelming amounts of support requests right from the start. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I had no idea if SearchWP would be successful given the landscape, I built it first to scratch my own itch while knowing that even if no one bought it, I would 100% use it in my own work, and use it&nbsp;<em>a lot</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His gamble paid off and the plugin has been used on more than 30,000 WordPress sites. Christopher had one support contractor but otherwise had been running the business alone for the past eight years. WordPress&rsquo; growing market share has made one-person plugin businesses difficult to maintain once they become very popular, as seen in the recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/delicious-brains-acquires-advanced-custom-fields-plugin\">sale of ACF to Delicious Brains</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I was looking ahead and considering what would be best for SearchWP&rsquo;s customers,&rdquo; Christopher said. &ldquo;I want SearchWP to live as long as it possibly can. If I&rsquo;m by myself it&rsquo;s a bit of a risk to continue that way as the business continues to grow. I know that I prefer to build things from the ground up, and I also know that I&rsquo;m not the guy to build (or manage) a team, it&rsquo;s not my strong suit. Given all of those pieces it was clear to me that it was a good time to consider selling.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Christopher described the 2013 WordPress ecosystem as more &ldquo;scrappy,&rdquo; as developers launched product businesses and worked to figure it out along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are pros and cons to an environment like that, but it was fantastic from my perspective,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Over time that feeling went away as companies grew, matured, and playbooks began to take shape. That cycle has continued over time and especially in the last 18 months we&rsquo;re getting a look at where WordPress is headed &ndash; lots of big players in a really big space.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are jumping into the waters with a new product business, Christopher underscored the need for strong marketing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think that a lack of serious marketing will in fact be a limiter in today&rsquo;s WordPress economy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Products that have been around a long time have a natural momentum that&rsquo;s really tough to beat, but that momentum doesn&rsquo;t come without friction. In order to keep up with where WordPress is going, I do feel like you need assets (and capital) aimed directly and solely at marketing for the long haul.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Balkhi did not elaborate on Awesome Motive&rsquo;s immediate plans for the search plugin but said the company will be executing on a 12-month plan to make it easier for beginners and non-technical business owners to set up in less than 10 minutes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 09 Jul 2021 03:17:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 11.0 Includes Over 70 Bug Fixes, Continues Improving With WordPress 5.8 Just Two Weeks Away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119703\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:265:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-0-includes-over-70-bug-fixes-continues-improving-with-wordpress-5-8-just-two-weeks-away?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-11-0-includes-over-70-bug-fixes-continues-improving-with-wordpress-5-8-just-two-weeks-away\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6795:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 11.0 landed yesterday with a pile of changes. The development team has been moving fast, and it shows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a two-week cycle, version 11.0 includes an insane number of bug fixes. Contributors squashed over 70 in this release alone. This seems to be in preparation for WordPress 5.8, which is expected to land on July 20. The upcoming block-based Widgets screen had the lion&rsquo;s share of bugs. However, the block library had nearly two dozen, many of those issues with new theme-related blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The downside of such a massive release is that there are too many features and not enough time to cover them all. I will be cherry-picking some of my favorites, but feel free to dive into the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v11.0.0\">release notes</a> for a complete picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Theme and Template-Editing Mode Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">One of the primary Full Site Editing features making its way to WordPress 5.8 will be disabled by default for most users. In a rare move from the core project, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32858\">template editor will be opt-in</a>, at least for users with classic themes.  It is opt-out for block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/getting-to-know-the-upcoming-wordpress-5-8-template-editor\">wrote last month</a>, until users are on actual block themes, the template editor is &ldquo;a sort-of-OK-but-kind-of-amazing landing page creator.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Template-editing is really only as good as the weakest link in the system. This will almost always be the theme over the next few months. Because the template editor is a new feature that directly attempts to overwrite the front-end output, it will always be at odds with many themes that were never designed with it in mind. The opt-in approach is unlikely the best route to mass adoption, but it is in the interest of the user experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Making it opt-in also allows theme authors to make template editing a smooth experience. Gutenberg 11.0 introduces a new <code>defaultBlockTemplate</code> editor setting. Theme authors can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32771\">create the default blocks</a> that users begin with when creating a new template.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Starting with a custom default block template.\n\n\n\n<p>Ideally, this default template should include some base layout components, such as a header, footer, and post/page content. However, themers are free to put their own spin on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on creating default block templates, theme authors should read Themes Team rep Carolina Nymark&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/07/08/summary-theme-features-in-wordpress-5-8/\">overview of WordPress 5.8 theme features</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Media &amp; Text Block: Drag-and-Drop Media Replacement</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Dragging a new media file into the Media &amp; Text block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Users have long been able to drag and drop an initial image or video into the Media &amp; Text block. However, they were unable to replace it using the same method. Gutenberg 11.0 creates a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/29710\">&ldquo;drop zone&rdquo; over the media column</a>, making it easy to change the media to something new.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feature already exists with the Cover and Image blocks, so this change brings Media &amp; Text up to date. We probably should have had this feature months ago, but the patch sat in limbo waiting for a code review.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Accessibility: Categories Dropdown Has Label</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Label difference between the Archives and Categories blocks.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">The development team added a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/33060\">&ldquo;Categories&rdquo; label</a> when the Categories block is shown as a dropdown. This is a welcome improvement to help those using screen-readers better navigate the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The problem with this change is the lack of consistency. In <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-8-adds-new-typography-controls-and-block-previews\">Gutenberg 10.8</a>, the team removed the <code>.screen-reader-text</code> class for the Archives block label, making it appear on screen for all users. These types of inconsistencies that seem trivial on the surface tend to pile up, creating code bloat for theme designers in the long run as they try to wrangle them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would prefer both labels to be marked as screen-reader text. Regardless of the default, the two should match. Then, throw in an option for the end-user to decide whether to show the label similar to how the Search form handles it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Return of Post Classes</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Post classes appear for Post Template block.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For those theme designers who need them, Gutenberg 11.0 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/30497\">brings back post classes</a>. If you are wondering where posts classes had gone, you may not be alone. In the world of blocks, they are not needed as much as they once were. Traditionally, WordPress theme authors used these classes to dynamically change the output of a post based on contexts such as type, format, category, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the Post Template block (formerly named Query Loop) was introduced, there was a noticeable lack of the traditional classes attached to the wrapper for individual posts. This latest update brings them back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, block themes will likely rely on these classes less and less. With much of the design configuration moving to <code>theme.json</code> files and user-controlled options, it is probably time to say goodbye to one of the core features of theme design over the past decade. However, it is a comfort to know it is there when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Decimals Allowed in Spacing Controls</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">For those who are particular about getting their margin and padding <em>just</em> right, they can finally rejoice. Spacing controls now <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/32692\">allow for decimal values</a> and not just whole numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In past versions of the plugin, a value such as <code>1.5</code> would be rounded up to <code>2</code>. When used with <code>rem</code> and <code>em</code> units, such rounding created a 50% difference between the intended spacing and reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am happy about this one. It is a fix for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31964\">one of the tickets</a> I opened (<em>hooray for contributing!</em>).

I even began building one years ago before ultimately abandoning it for a simple Markdown solution in a private repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes Hypernotes unique is its handling of &ldquo;folders,&rdquo; which essentially work like categories. However, each folder gets its own sub-menu link under the Notes section in the WordPress admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Hypernotes&rsquo; folder system.\n\n\n\n<p>This more closely mimics other note-taking apps where users can switch between various folders to quickly find notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The code to make this happen is simple; the idea is ingenious. It is the sort of outside-the-box thinking I love to see from plugin developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few trivial issues with it, such as the folder names not being highlighted when viewing their screens. However, that is a WordPress-specific bug. A simple dash before each folder name could spruce up the UI a bit too. They sit below the &ldquo;All Notes&rdquo; menu item, so it would create more of a folder effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the whole, the plugin works well as a note-taking application.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Writing a note in the WordPress editor.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin description does have a security note for users who are wondering just how private their content is:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Only you will be able to see your notes within the WordPress admin, but the notes are NOT encrypted at the moment, so anyone with database access will be able to read them.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypernotes also ensures that no post is ever accidentally published for all the world to see. Under the hood, it automatically sets all notes to the &ldquo;private&rdquo; status. The plugin&rsquo;s post type cannot be publicly queried on the front end either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is worth mentioning that the plugin does not create custom capabilities (permissions) for its post type and taxonomy. Any registered user on the site with the right post-editing capabilities can access others&rsquo; notes in the backend, such as people with the Editor role.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is unlikely an issue given the nature of the plugin. I imagine the primary audience will be made up of solo bloggers who want a simple note-taking solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I ran into one not-so-trivial issue when I began trying out Hypernotes, believing my website was broken. This is usually because of a patch I am testing for the Gutenberg plugin or just one of its run-of-the-mill updates. However, the typical culprit was not to blame. After a half-hour or so trying to figure out why my theme styles were not appearing for Note posts, I finally cracked the issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hypernotes disables all theme editor styles. The beautiful typography of my currently active theme was gone, which would work well with a note or journaling plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was easy enough to overrule with a few lines of custom code. If I was going to save a few quotes that I liked as personal notes, I at least wanted to do it in style:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Bringing back my theme&rsquo;s custom quotes style.\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also attempts to disable wide/full alignment and theme editor font sizes. The code it uses works for traditional WordPress themes but not for block themes, which have a different mechanism for registering such support. This was also one of the reasons it was tough to track down the issue. Everything else from my theme was working but custom editor styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I understand the idea behind removing support for those features. Themes design the front end of the site, and Hypernotes is purely a backend tool. However, I would rather see an option for letting the user control what gets disabled. Some theme editor styles would pair well with the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Disabling these features has other implications too. For example, all of my theme&rsquo;s custom block style variations were registered and usable from the editor. However, because my styles were not loaded, they did not work correctly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option would be for the plugin to provide its own editor styles. There would still be some complications going that route, such as the block style variations issue, but the plugin could become a beautifully designed note-taking app in its own right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a version 1.0 outing, I am a fan of the simplicity. More so, I am impressed with the clever method of handling note &ldquo;folders.&rdquo; I am eager to see how this plugin evolves over future iterations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 08 Jul 2021 03:13:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Matt: Open Insulin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=54516\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://ma.tt/2021/07/open-insulin/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:895:\"<p>One of my big themes is that open source will transform every industry, with key examples being WordPress in web publishing, WooCommerce in online commerce, Wikipedia in reference, and Bitcoin/Ethereum in finance.

It also makes it possible to add a bearded man or a bearded woman in all skin tone variations.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 will also include significant changes to the syringe emoji that were committed to a previous version of Twemoji (13.0.2) earlier this year. Instead of a blood-filled barrel accented with drops of blood leaking out of the tip, the new syringe emoji contains a non-specific liquid. This makes it more flexible for use cases that don&rsquo;t involve removing blood. Emojipedia has a fascinating look at <a href=\"https://blog.emojipedia.org/vaccine-emoji-comes-to-life/\">the syringe emoji&rsquo;s history</a>, dating back to 1999 when it was primarily used in Japan for blood donation. A 2021 refresh on the syringe makes it possible for it to be used in reference to vaccines, a topic of public conversation across the globe.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to changes to the syringe, Jonathan Desrosiers, who opened the trac ticket to initiate the update, summarized a few other changes from previous Twemoji versions that modify existing emoji:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Cricket: the colors have been adjusted to improve readability on small screens and to prevent confusion with other Emoji that had a similar color.</li><li>T-Rex: The color and posture of the T-Rex has been adjusted.</li><li>Portuguese flag: A line within the flag&rsquo;s circle has been corrected.</li><li>Thai flag: The proportions of the stripes for this flag have been corrected.</li><li>Fox face: The symmetry has been improved.</li><li>Transgender flag: The lines have been updated to prevent small gaps between stripes from showing when rendered with antialiasing.</li><li>Rolling on the floor laughing: Adjusted to be less exaggerated and appear more natural.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The official emoji lexicon is constantly being tweaked and updated for accuracy, and to better serve conversations, as current events increase demand for visual representations of specific objects and emotions. Although many of these updates and new additions may seem pandemic-inspired, there&rsquo;s a lengthy, official process for proposing changes to the Unicode Consortium. The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee reviews <a href=\"https://unicode.org/emoji/proposals.html\">proposals</a>, which require compelling data on compatibility, expected usage level, distinctiveness, and other factors. Candidates approved for inclusion do not arrive to major platforms for approximately a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.8 will bump Twemoji from 13.0.1 to 13.1.0. Unicode 14.0, the next major update, is expected for release in late 2021. Emojipedia has a <a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/emoji-14.0/\">draft list</a> of what is on deck for the next version and those that are approved would likely make it to major platforms by the end of 2022.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Jul 2021 05:16:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: Jetpack 9.9 Released With a Refreshed Image Gallery Carousel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119629\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:185:\"https://wptavern.com/jetpack-9-9-released-with-a-refreshed-image-gallery-carousel?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=jetpack-9-9-released-with-a-refreshed-image-gallery-carousel\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3094:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Today, Automattic <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/2021/07/06/jetpack-9-9-make-your-best-photos-shine/\">released version 9.9</a> of its popular Jetpack plugin. The development team improved the modal animation and transition speed for the Instant Search module and added the Social Preview panel to the pre-publish sidebar. However, the most notable user-facing update was a refresh of its Carousel feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The module creates a fullscreen overlay gallery of a post&rsquo;s images once one is clicked. Users can <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/carousel/\">enable this feature</a> via the Jetpack &gt; Settings &gt; Writing page in the WordPress admin. Users can also turn on the display of EXIF data and the media attachment commenting form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack Carousel handles Image and Gallery blocks a bit differently. Regardless of whether Gallery images are linked or not, they will always be included in the image carousel when clicked. However, only Image blocks that specifically link to the attachment page are added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have never much cared for the Jetpack Carousel feature. There were always prettier image-overlay, lightbox-type solutions out in the wild. We use the plugin here at WP Tavern, so it is just something I have learned to live with. There was no sense in installing <em>yet another</em> plugin when we were already using the massive mono-project to run many other features on the site. And, it generally got the job done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, today, I can finally say that I am happy with the implementation. It is cleaner, offers a larger viewing area for individual images, and tucks unnecessary bits away for the average user.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following is a screenshot of the carousel in all its fullscreen wonder:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Jetpack carousel in version 9.9.\n\n\n\n<p>For comparison, here is what the same image slide looks like in Jetpack 9.8.1:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Jetpack carousel in version 9.8.1.\n\n\n\n<p>In the new version, the image metadata and commenting form are hidden by default. The user must click the info or comment icon buttons to slide each section open. This is a better implementation because it decreases the noise in the carousel while still making the features available for those who want them.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Image metadata in the carousel.\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, I am enjoying this update. Swiping and scrolling through the gallery feels smoother.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would love for WordPress to bring a standard set of functions and blocks for displaying media metadata to the development community. Every plugin and theme author who wants to showcase that info must build a custom system for their projects, such as formatting aperture, shutter speed, and focal length. The following is the output of an image attachment page from a theme I have worked on:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom theme image info.\n\n\n\n<p>There is no reason that the theme and Jetpack should be working with custom wrappers for the metadata. WordPress stores EXIF and ID3 tags automatically.

I closed all the windows, shuttered the blinds, switched on a couple of fans for white noise, and clicked the television on. My cats and I relaxed. It is my job to keep them calm while my &mdash; usually drunken &mdash; compatriots burn hundreds of dollars away in the night sky. It is my ritual, and I enjoy it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this holiday, we re-watched Season 1 of <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>, and I learned how to build a block plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not my first attempt. When the block editor launched nearly three years ago, I tinkered with a few block type ideas. However, I never got far. Documentation was sparse, and I had almost no experience with JavaScript beyond building trivial bells and whistles for front-end design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaving my day job as a developer to write for WP Tavern also meant limited time to learn block development. And, my free time for the last couple of years has been filled with other projects. Lately, I have had the urge to jump back in and start building things for fun once again. My extended sabbatical from development work gave me time to pursue other interests while allowing my well of creativeness a chance to refill. The break did me some good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With time to kill yesterday afternoon, I dove right in. After a couple of hours of reading docs, studying other developers&rsquo; code, and breaking things, I had a functional block for a breadcrumbs list.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom block registered and ready to insert.\n\n\n\n<p>Marcus Kazmierczak&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/copyright-block/\">Copyright Block</a> plugin helped me get over one of the initial humps. It was helpful to see real-world, non-example code written in vanilla JavaScript to get to the meat of how the system worked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>My overall thoughts on building custom block types?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was easier than I thought it would be. <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/\">Documentation</a> is, at the same time, both overwhelming and limiting. It is tough to find the correct answer if you do not even know what you are looking for. The barrier to entry is much higher than when I built my first plugin in 2007. The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/writing-your-first-block-type/\">Block Type API</a> makes some things stupidly simple but complicates others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Successfully inserting my first block type into the editor canvas was gratifying. I don&rsquo;t think that feeling ever goes away as a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Successful insertion and rendering of my first block plugin.\n\n\n\n<p>I am excited about the potential for blocks, such as a breadcrumbs list, when the site editor launches. Many similar features do not make sense in the post editor. However, when users can make direct edits to their templates, it will open a world of possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Learning Curve</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">I know enough JavaScript to be a danger to myself and others. Having spent almost the entirety of my professional career in the WordPress realm has meant focusing on PHP. But, programming is programming. Once you have a strong understanding of one language, it not an impossible leap to piddle around enough to create a functional script in another. Most of the same foundational concepts are there. The hurdle is often with learning some new syntax.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the biggest obstacle with &ldquo;modern&rdquo; JavaScript is setting up the build tools, bundlers, and more. It can be a tall order to even type out that first line of code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure, some of the documentation has vanilla JavaScript examples, but when you get into anything more complex than the basics, it is not so vanilla anymore. You will need a way to bundle JavaScript and transform JSX syntax. That means tools like webpack and Babel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/javascript/js-build-setup/\">WordPress has its own script</a> for cutting through most of the complexity, but I recommend <a href=\"https://laravel-mix.com/\">Laravel Mix</a>. It is simple enough for even the least-savvy JavaScript programmers among us and has thorough documentation. It is a script made for folks who want to worry less about tooling and more about actually writing code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block building is also a different kind of leap. Whether it was custom template tags, shortcodes, widgets, or hooks, traditional WordPress development has meant building those in a PHP environment.  I suspect that most plugin developers have tons of features that they can bring to the masses via the block editor. They will often rely on server-side rendering. WordPress has a <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-server-side-render/\"><code>ServerSideRender</code> componen</a>t for actually handling this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the handiest features of registering block types is the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/\">block &ldquo;supports&rdquo; system</a>. <em>Want a background color option?</em> Just one line of code will do. <em>Want the user to access the font-size control?</em> That is a single line too. With little effort, I extended my breadcrumbs block to include a ton of styling options for users. And, they adapt to the site&rsquo;s active theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Testing various combination of block-supported styling options.\n\n\n\n<p>The list of block-supported features offers an array of standardized options at pretty much no development cost. Even the Customize API, previously the most advanced tool for building form fields, did not come this close.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/block-tutorial/block-controls-toolbar-and-sidebar/\">Building custom inspector controls</a> was straightforward once I got the hang of how the block edit piece of the puzzle worked. For now, I have a simple toggle option for enabling/disabling a feature. Often, the hardest part is just finding what you are looking for. WordPress has a massive library of <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/components/\">components</a> to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this point, I have a basic block on the client (editor) side. Most of the complexity is handled on the server via PHP. If I could build this in an afternoon while attending to nervous cats, it should not be a stretch for more plugin authors to hop aboard this train. There are thousands of shortcodes and widgets that developers can convert to blocks with minimal code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am not ready to release my breadcrumbs block into the wild just yet. There is still some fine-tuning left to do and a few advanced features to implement. Also, a breadcrumbs list is primarily needed in a site editor context where users can drop it into something like their header template. We are not there yet, but I will undoubtedly share the final result with the community when we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next, I will try to build a block that does not rely on server-side rendering. I think I have the hang of it now. Breaking through that initial barrier is always the hardest step.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 06 Jul 2021 00:28:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 12: WordPress – In Person!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=10889\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/episode-12-wordpress-in-person/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13116:\"<p>In this episode, Josepha Haden Chomphosy talks about WordPress &#8211; In Person!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:39</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re talking about one of my favorite parts of the project &#8211; WordPress events. The in-person component of the project is the dark matter that helps us build resilience and thrive as a group. A lot of what I&#8217;m going to share applies to every WordPress event, whether it&#8217;s a meetup or workshop, a contributor day, any other sort of format. But I&#8217;ll be focused on WordCamps. It&#8217;s been a while since we had any in-person WordCamps. Our last two were WordCamp Malaga in Spain and WordCamp Greenville in the US. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped anyone from gathering people together online. Which honestly makes a lot of sense for WordPress. Because there are many reasons we gather, the main three reasons are connecting, inspiring, and contributing. It&#8217;s true. It says so right in our documentation, &#8220;paper rustling.&#8221; All WordPress events should connect WordPress users, inspire people to do more with WordPress, and contribute to the WordPress project. As an aside, I&#8217;ll tell you that some groups also get to collaborate and educate in there, but connect, inspire, contribute. Those are the big three. And that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m talking about today. And if you subscribe to this podcast for the back office deep cuts, I&#8217;ll also have a few of those for you. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:57</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so first up, connect. WordCamps are generally annual-ish gatherings organized by local WordPress meetup groups. They&#8217;re not meant to be big or fancy. The definition of the minimum viable product for WordCamp is 50 people gathered all day to talk about WordPress. They are intentionally affordable to allow people from all walks of life to attend, meet, share and learn. This is made possible by donations and sponsorships from local businesses and larger businesses in the WordPress ecosystem. And this helps us get people connected to those in their community that works with or are sustained by WordPress. That connection feeds into the overall health of the global WordPress project. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up is inspire. WordCamps do not discriminate. They are open to any WordPress users, developers, designers, or other enthusiasts, regardless of their level of experience. And because of this, sessions generally span a variety of formats. So presentations or live demos to workshops or panels, any other format you can think of. But that also means that there are a variety of skill levels represented. There&#8217;s always content about how to use WordPress. That’s a given. But you can also count on content that inspires people to do more with their own dreams and aspirations. When I was still organizing WordCamps, my favorite thing was seeing people who came back year after year, putting into practice something that they learned the year before. It is that <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> aspect to WordCamps that lets people see the edge of their ideas and then expand that just a little bit further. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, contribute. WordCamps often have a contribution component to them. Sometimes it&#8217;s just a talk telling you how you can get more involved in the WordPress project. But sometimes, it&#8217;s a whole contributor day. And those range in size from single focus, like everyone, will show up and learn how to review a theme or a focus from every team that we have, like at the big flagship events where we gather hundreds of people into a room just to contribute to WordPress and all of the teams that go with it. Getting started with contributing can be daunting, but it is also essential to avoid something called the Tragedy of the Commons, an economic concept. So I&#8217;ll share a link to that in the show notes below. But the most important thing, the most important thing to remember, is that WordPress is open source. And we asked people to help us keep this great tool running by giving back a little bit of their time if they have gotten any benefit from the WordPress project or CMS over the course of their careers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:40</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s it. The three big things you can get from a WordCamp. I know that I can&#8217;t wait to get back to them myself because while a lot of these things can still happen online and do, it&#8217;s really hard to replace the dark matter of in-person connections for open source projects. And since we&#8217;re talking dark matter anyway, let&#8217;s dig into it a little.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:01</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the start of the section, I mentioned that WordCamps are local, locally organized, and people are encouraged to attend locally. But I am part of a group that ends up traveling to a lot of WordCamps. If you don&#8217;t know about the unseen work of WordPress, this raises eyebrows. So here is some clarification around the back office work that some of these traveling WordCampers often do. When I listed these out, there were about 20 different tasks, 20 different jobs, which was, frankly, a bit overwhelming when I listed them that way. So I&#8217;ve grouped them into kind of two genres, each with a group of current versus future types of work. So my two big buckets, big picture stuff, and then community stewardship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:50</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The big picture stuff, our first big genre here, when you&#8217;re looking at current topics, current issues kind of information, when we&#8217;re working on big picture stuff, you get the clarification of the mission or vision of WordPress, the sharing of open source methods or processes that we use in the WordPress project, and also sometimes those goal-setting conversations that you have to have both because we have a bunch of teams and team reps, that have a lot of really great ideas about what can be done in their teams to help WordPress succeed. But then also, because when you are working, when you&#8217;re contributing to a single team in the project, it can sometimes be hard to know how your work relates to the overall goals and visions of WordPress. And so that&#8217;s part of the work that gets done that I do there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you&#8217;re looking at future topics, future issues, the second part of this genre, that stuff like starting conversations or discussions around what the future holds for WordPress, and that&#8217;s the project as well as the technology or hearing from people about big things coming up for them. And any content that can support it, anything that I can provide to support those big things. It&#8217;s also a good time for me and others to identify trends based on what I see in presentations or what I hear from people at social functions. Really, it&#8217;s just a huge opportunity for information gathering to make sure that I know what everyone else in the project is trying to do and if they understand what the project is trying to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second big genre of things that happen in that dark matter kind of work at WordCamps is what I call community stewardship—so taking care of the community itself for the project itself. And a lot of that work is actually incident response kind of work. So conflict resolution, mediation often happens at in-person events, but also uncovering the shared foundations, the shared understanding for upcoming changes. So a lot of really, in the weeds kind of change management work. And for me, it&#8217;s certainly doing my best as a cultural liaison when I do see that there has been some miscommunication or gathering context for the latest disagreement that people are having with me so that I can clarify anything that was misunderstood from what I said. And also a little bit of policy clarification, just explaining why we do things and the way we do them. So for community stewardship, that&#8217;s kind of the current stuff that we look at. And that I do when I&#8217;m traveling for WordCamps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:36</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for the future tasks that we do with community stewardship in the project, that stuff like training, and that&#8217;s training team reps, community deputies, or new contributors like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not really one type of training, necessarily. But then also, all of the checking in with our organizers, team reps, volunteers, sponsors, everyone like that, to make sure that what we have in the project and what&#8217;s happening in the project, the tools that we have, the experience that contributors have while they are working here, and WordPress is good, and is what they need. We&#8217;ve got a lot of tools to get things done in WordPress, and we can always make them better. And so checking in with people to kind of see how those processes are, how the tools are making sure that I have an idea of where our holes are and what needs to be patched, and how we can patch them in the long run. So that&#8217;s all of the future planning kind of work and topic stuff, just you know, making sure that WordPress has what it needs to survive long into the future and long after I&#8217;m doing anything with it, and long after you&#8217;re doing anything with it either.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, lots and lots of unseen work being done at our in-person events. But folks who keep a keen eye on the online global work of WordPress will probably recognize that a lot of that work is also done routinely on make.wordpress.org and within the making WordPress Slack. There’s just, I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s just something different about receiving information from a human being with a face rather than an avatar with a photo. So I guess at the end of the day, that means the dark matter that keeps open source together is really an issue of communication. And you&#8217;ll get no arguments for me there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:44</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And there&#8217;s really just one big thing. And that&#8217;s WordPress 5.8. We are about two weeks away from this big release; the community has been working tirelessly on it. And it&#8217;s shaping up to be one of the most tested releases that we&#8217;ve had in a long time. Myself, I&#8217;m grateful to see so much activity before the release. Since 5.8 and 5.9 releases represent such monumental shifts in our software, I&#8217;m incredibly grateful to see so much activity prior to the release, especially in the beta period. We&#8217;ve been testing everything for it feels like six or eight months, and we&#8217;re really starting to see the positive benefits of that. And I think that we, the WordPress community, should be really proud of everything that we&#8217;re going to ship in 2021. Okay, so that was less of a small list of big things and really like one big thing with a generous garnish of encouragement, but you deserve it. So thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 05 Jul 2021 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Chloe Bringmann\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"Gutenberg Times: Block-Based Widget Screen and DevNotes Galore for WordPress 5.8 – Weekend Edition #176\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18404\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/block-based-widget-screen-weekend-edition-176/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19897:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>July is the month celebrating North American Independence (for white people) and the start of the French Revolution. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happy 154th Birthday, Canada 🇨🇦  (July 1st). <br />Happy 245th Birthday, USA 🇺🇸 (July 4th) <br />Happy 232nd Bastille Day, France 🇫🇷  (July 14th) </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are many more countries celebrating Independence Day in July, though. <a href=\"https://www.infoplease.com/culture-entertainment/holidays/national-holidays-around-world\">Here is the list.

While the WPAdmin Widget screen feels like a good block editor, he wrote about the block widgets in the Customizer: &#8220;Customizer support for block widgets is light years ahead of where it was just a few short months ago. However, it feels awkward at best. There is a deep feeling of not belonging.

The company raised money from all the investors in this round via a SAFE note, which founder and CEO Craig Hewitt said is a fairly standard investment vehicle for companies at Castos&rsquo; stage of growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;On both the individual and corporate investor side I think the investors see the vision that we have for what the Private Podcasting market can mean for Castos and want to help us achieve that potential,&rdquo; Hewitt said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Private Podcasting is a growing trend where creators and organizations broadcast to supporters in a more intimate format that isn&rsquo;t open to the public. Hewitt likens them to membership sites, except in audio format. It is often used by people who are running membership sites, courses, or online communities as a way to stay connected with members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The other application is companies wanting a way to connect with their employees in audio format,&rdquo; Hewitt said. &ldquo;Podcasting is perfect for that because it&rsquo;s mobile-first, on-demand, and can be consumed asynchronously.&nbsp; We call it the&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://castos.com/step-away-experience/\" target=\"_blank\">Step Away Experience</a>.&nbsp;Companies that are adopting Private Podcasting internally are giving their team members a way to consume their internal content without being tied to their computer on a Zoom call or glued to Slack.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Castos is developing a mobile app specifically targeted at the private podcasting market. Hewitt&rsquo;s team is aiming to have the app become a place where people can listen to all of the private podcasts for which they have a subscription. Listeners would simply use the app instead of going through the process of manually subscribing to all their private podcasts via RSS feed. New episodes will appear automatically in the app for subscribers.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For our corporate clients, the ability to white label our app with their own branding/style is a big win,&rdquo; Hewitt said.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also a much more secure way to distribute private podcast content.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no RSS feed to share around, no files to download (our app is streaming only to offer more security to those files).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The pandemic <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcasting-during-the-pandemic-castos-sees-300-growth-in-new-podcasters\">ramped up unprecedented interest in podcasting</a> when lockdowns were in place across the globe. Even with vaccines more readily available now, Hewitt said Castos is still witnessing strong growth in the podcasting industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There are all the new podcasters in the market now since so many launched podcasts during the pandemic, but now that people are traveling again and commuting to work we&rsquo;re seeing listenership going up quite a bit,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;&ldquo;This is a trend we expect to continue into the future.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past 10 months, Castos has grown to serve nearly 3,500 customers and the team has grown from seven employees to 13. The company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/seriously-simple-podcasting/\">Seriously Simple Podcasting</a> plugin is used on more than 30,000 WordPress sites. Castos is actively <a href=\"http://castos.com/careers\">hiring for several roles</a> right now, thanks to the new round of fundraising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;All of the funds will go towards growing our team,&rdquo; Hewitt said. &ldquo;This will be pretty evenly split between product (designers and developers) and Sales and Marketing roles &ndash; more people, more energy, more great minds working on ways that we can better serve our customers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 03 Jul 2021 02:18:40 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress Biratnagar Announces Plans for Ujwal Thapa Memorial Scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119267\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:211:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-biratnagar-announces-plans-for-ujwal-thapa-memorial-scholarship?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordpress-biratnagar-announces-plans-for-ujwal-thapa-memorial-scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3468:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Earlier this week, the WordPress Biratnagar Facebook group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wordpressbrt/posts/1170172963498116\">announced a WordCamp scholarship</a> in honor of Ujwal Thapa. The goal is to honor the legacy left behind by one of Nepal&rsquo;s leaders both inside and outside of the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thapa <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ujwal-thapa-co-founder-of-the-wordpress-nepal-community-passes-away\">passed away a month ago</a> at age 44 from complications with COVID-19. He was a political activist, founding the Bibeksheel Nepali party, originally a peaceful movement against corruption and social injustice. He was the co-founder of WordPress Nepal, a group that has grown to 8,000 members. He was also a close friend and mentor to many in the community and helped many more launch careers in the IT industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;After the untimely death of WordPress contributor and co-founder of WordPress Nepal Ujwal Thapa in 2021, due to COVID-19, the WordPress Biratnagar community decided on this scholarship,&rdquo; wrote the WordPress Biratnagar team. &ldquo;Ujwal was a dedicated patron to the WordPress community in Nepal, and the WordPress Biratnagar decided to pay applause to his memory in this way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The scholarship will cover the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Travel to Biratnagar from within Nepal.</li><li>Hotel stay for the duration of the event.</li><li>A ticket to <a href=\"https://biratnagar.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp Biratnagar</a>.</li><li>Local transportation.</li><li>Meals outside the official event.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Nepal is still struggling with getting COVID-19 cases under control at the moment. The CDC <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/notices/covid-4/coronavirus-nepal\">lists the country</a> as &ldquo;very high&rdquo; risk and recommends avoiding travel. There is no date set for a physical conference, and a WordCamp Biratnagar 2021 event is unlikely. The organizing team may not be able to grant a scholarship until next year at the earliest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Biratnagar lead organizer Ganga Kafle said they are just waiting for the situation to return to normal but cannot be sure when that will happen. While there is no date for the next WordCamp, they are still holding regular meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The group is still discussing the details of the scholarship. Currently, they plan to consult with other community groups within Nepal and the global community. Any help creating and maintaining such a scholarship system would be welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress Biratnagar team did agree to some guidelines. Once submissions open, applicants must be Nepalese. &ldquo;We believe that empowering community members is an excellent way to honor his memory and carry on his legacy,&rdquo; wrote the team in its announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Group leaders mostly agreed to award the scholarship to those meeting the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People with disabilities.</li><li>People from lower-income families.</li><li>Women interested in WordPress.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The group said the selection process would be completely transparent, and the awarded scholarship would be at the discretion of the current WordCamp Biratnagar organizers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kafle said the scholarship would also be annual. The team plans to keep this going in honor of Thapa and paying respect to the man who helped jump-start many of their careers and involvement with WordPress.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 23:25:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: The Month in WordPress: June 2021\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=10896\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2021/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11387:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Once you step into contribution time, your main concern is the users of WordPress, or new contributors, or the health of the WordPress ecosystem as a whole or the WordPress project.

The checklist is still applicable to all meetup groups but in places where vaccines are freely available, meetup organizers can now forego its requirements if they limit gatherings to those self-reporting as fully vaccinated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Andrea Middleton <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-discusses-adding-vaccination-status-to-in-person-meetup-safety-checklist\">proposed adding vaccination status</a> to the checklist in mid-May, the idea was met with a wide range of concerns and strong opinions. WordPress&rsquo; global community has experienced the pandemic in different ways, living under a spectrum of local restrictions, with disparate access to vaccines and varying responses to available vaccines. Some participants in the discussions were concerned about organizers having to request information about vaccination status from attendees, which is illegal in many places. Middleton clarified that attendance would be based on the honor system, and organizers would not be requesting any health information from individuals. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The WordPress community team is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;expecting or requiring local organizers to organize in-person events for fully-vaccinated people &mdash; we&rsquo;re simply removing the barrier to doing so,&rdquo; she said. The decision <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/07/01/in-person-meetup-events-for-vaccinated-community-members/\">announcement</a> includes a flow chart for the conditions that are now in place:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Middleton characterized the proposal as contentious and something that may be an unpopular decision. Participants in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2021/05/12/proposal-adding-vaccination-status-to-the-in-person-meetup-safety-checklist/\">discussion</a> got heated in expressing their opinions, which varied greatly based on each person&rsquo;s unique pandemic experiences and convictions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some think it overstepping to prohibit unvaccinated people from attending meetups, others think only allowing vaccinated attendees would create a &ldquo;two-tiered&rdquo; meetup program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This proposal means that multiple groups of people will no longer be allowed to attend our meetings,&rdquo; Taco Verdonschot commented. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re limited to the meetings that are streamed online. They&rsquo;re basically second class citizens in our community now. They can&rsquo;t join the party, they have to watch through the window. Just this idea makes me extremely uncomfortable.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Verdonschot cited several examples of people who might be excluded by the proposal to restart meetups for vaccinated attendees:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>People with a low income in areas where the vaccines aren&rsquo;t provided for free</li><li>Younger people in countries where vaccinations are administered to the elderly first, and only slowly make their way to the younger generations (like The Netherlands)</li><li>People who cannot get a vaccination for medical reasons, for example, because of known allergic reactions to vaccinations</li><li>Pregnant women</li><li>People with a limited immune system</li><li>People whose religion doesn&rsquo;t allow them to get vaccinated</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I realize there are some on the team who do not agree, and I hope that these guidelines are flexible enough that you are able to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disagree_and_commit\">disagree and commit</a>&nbsp;in this case,&rdquo; Middleton said in the decision announcement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While I agree that it&rsquo;s only a matter of time when fully-vaxxed-only meetups are a thing of the past, I do think it&rsquo;s important to make that possible for our communities.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 02:52:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"WPTavern: Automattic Releases Sketch Block for Drawing in the WordPress Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119486\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:201:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-releases-sketch-block-for-drawing-in-the-wordpress-editor?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=automattic-releases-sketch-block-for-drawing-in-the-wordpress-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3872:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Automattic released a new plugin titled <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/sketch/\">Sketch Block</a> earlier today. It is a one-off block that allows end-users to draw directly in the editor. The plugin is marked as a beta release and requires Gutenberg to be activated to use. It is a part of the company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/block-experiments/tree/master/blocks/sketch\">Block Experiments project</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be perfectly honest, I spent an excessive amount of time playing around with this block plugin today. And, if I am going overboard with that honesty, most of that time was just trying to write out my name. It was hard not to. Drawing things directly in the editor is just kind of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Attempts to write my name with Sketch Block.\n\n\n\n<p>I am unsure how many practical uses the plugin actually has at its current stage, but not everything needs a purpose outside of pure entertainment. Like an embedded <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-a-saurus-embeds-a-side-scrolling-t-rex-game-via-the-block-editor\">Block-a-saurus game</a> and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wacky-world-of-sorta-brilliants-sorta-fun-block-plugins\">ghost-written headings</a>, sometimes we just need reminders about the wild and whacky side of the web. We also need to experiment with new ideas from time to time, which can lead to unexpected discoveries, creating the foundation of future technological advancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes we just need to relieve some stress and sketch out our names in a new tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested the block using my laptop&rsquo;s trackpad &mdash; not an ideal method for freehand drawing. Unfortunately, I did not have access to a larger touchscreen device for a more thorough test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The block offers a limited number of controls as of version 1.0.7. Users can select between three different stroke widths and choose from their theme&rsquo;s color palette. The block&rsquo;s height can be resized, but there seems to be a minimum of 200px.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did manage to break it a few times, running into the &ldquo;This block has encountered an error and cannot be previewed&rdquo; error. There also seemed to be an unknown minimum width, which could not be adjusted. My goal was to create a columnized team page with each member&rsquo;s signature beneath their profile photo. However, the Sketch block kept breaking outside of my columns. In the end, I created a single-member bio section:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Creating a profile card with Sketch Block\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is built on top of the <a href=\"https://github.com/steveruizok/perfect-freehand\">Perfect Freehand</a> JavaScript library. When comparing Automattic&rsquo;s block implementation to the <a href=\"https://perfect-freehand-example.vercel.app/\">library&rsquo;s demo</a>, the plugin falls short of offering the same experience in block form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perfect Freehand&rsquo;s demo felt smoother. I was able to consistently draw with more accuracy using my laptop&rsquo;s trackpad. I do not know if just the size of the drawing area made a difference or if the editor interfered with the feeling.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Drawing in the Perfect Freehand demo.\n\n\n\n<p>The JavaScript library has a ton of extra options too. Users can transform even the worst drawing into something a bit cleaner with the thinning, smoothing, streamline, and other controls. I would love to see the Sketch Block plugin integrate the full suite of tools available through Perfect Freehand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a few bumps, the plugin is a solid first release for a beta project. I am eagerly waiting for what future versions have in store. I also wonder what applications it might have outside of piddling around for fun, such as notetaking or animations.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 02 Jul 2021 01:50:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WPTavern: Gatsby WP Themes Launches New Marketplace\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=116788\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:147:\"https://wptavern.com/gatsby-wp-themes-launches-new-marketplace?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gatsby-wp-themes-launches-new-marketplace\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2861:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://gatsbywpthemes.com/\">Gatsby WP Themes</a> project has launched a new marketplace for developers who are building WordPress-powered sites with Gatsby on the frontend. Originally founded by Zac Gordon and Alexandra Spalato, the commercial venture is now primarily managed by Spalato and Paulina Hetman. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The team&rsquo;s first project involved <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gatsby-wordpress-themes-project-partners-with-theme-shops-to-port-popular-themes-to-gatsby\">porting the Twenty Twenty WordPress Theme</a> to a Gatsby WP Theme. They are now focused on creating commercial themes targeted at developers and agencies who can use them to save time when building clients&rsquo; sites. Gatsby is more well-suited to sites that don&rsquo;t have a lot of dynamic content, such as marketing or documentation sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gatsby WP Themes is launching with several starter themes with different styles for each child theme. They include designs suitable for blogs, personal sites, businesses, restaurants, and portfolios.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Gatsby themes have several distinct advantages over just grabbing a starter or boilerplate Gatsby site from GitHub. Spaloto identified a few reasons why developers might opt for using a theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Gatsby themes allow Gatsby site functionality to be packaged as a standalone product for reuse.</li><li>All of your default configuration lives in an npm package.</li><li>Themes are versioned packages that can be updated like any other package.</li><li>If you created multiple sites using the same theme, you can just update the central theme to push changes across all of them.</li><li>Themes are composable: You can install a blog theme alongside a notes theme, alongside an e-commerce theme (and so forth).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All themes in the new Gatsby WP Themes marketplace include built-in support for dynamic comments, search, Mailchimp integration, sitemaps, Google analytics or Google Tag Manager, and various widgets. The marketplace also includes Gatsby plugins that make popular WordPress plugins more compatible with Gatsby frontends.

It has been a slow process as I have patiently waited for the feature to mature into a powerful tool for end-users. I am still as much a believer now as I was then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is betting big on patterns too. The feature is now a top-level <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/33094\">site-editing component</a> with several sub-features under development. As Gutenberg project lead Matias Ventura noted, &ldquo;From directory browsing to placeholder setup to transformations, patterns are crucial component of the entire site editing scope.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year ago, patterns were just an idea, almost a footnote compared to other upcoming features. Since WordPress 5.5 included the Patterns API for developers, over 100 themes in the official directory bundle them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new pattern directory is launching on WordPress.org next month alongside the version 5.8 release. There are already over 30 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/\">community-contributed patterns</a> approved. More are likely to land in the coming weeks. The directory will also eventually be open to anyone who wants to submit new designs. Any WordPress user will have the choice to select from this collection directly from their WordPress admin interface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These ideas are just scratching the surface.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At its core, the block patterns feature is a simple way of bundling one or more blocks into a preconfigured design. Users can point and click to insert them into their post or page content. The goal of the block system is not just to be a page builder where users must create everything from scratch. While we want it to be flexible enough to do that, most users should have the ability to simply insert sections of a design and customize them. This could be as simple as an audio player with a background to a portfolio layout that showcases their latest projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, the user experience is only set up to handle a dozen or patterns at a time &mdash; too many choices can be a less-than-ideal adventure. As the library grows, the interface will need to evolve with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>How can we build experiences on top of this foundation that mitigates some of the complexity?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg development team is already working on multiple solutions, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/28736\">contextual suggestions</a> for a selected block. However, one of the more promising features is patterns registered for specific block types. In this case, template parts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a user wants to select a new pattern for the header of their website, they should not have to sort through every option to find something. With Header patterns, the editor presents the user with a carousel of choices to scroll through specific to that template part.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><img /></li></ul>Scrolling through header patterns.\n\n\n\n<p>This same feature is possible with footers too:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a footer pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>Those who have been beta testing WordPress 5.8 or running the Gutenberg plugin in the last few months may have noticed some similarities to the Query Loop block (formerly named Query). It is the same underlying system that allows developers to attach patterns to a specific block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users can already select from multiple Query Loop patterns when first inserting the block:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Selecting a Query Loop pattern.\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Recent improvements to the Template Part and Query Loop blocks has opened up a whole new world for how patterns can be used,&rdquo; wrote Kjell Reigstad in a recent <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2021/06/25/theme-patterns-for-the-site-editor/\">ThemeShaper blog post</a>. &ldquo;Both blocks can now display a carousel of block patterns in their setup state, allowing users to choose between a menu of pre-designed versions of these blocks. These patterns can be bundled with your theme, so that users have a wide range of pre-designed header, query, and footer options available to choose from in the Site Editor.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reigstad has an <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31610\">open ticket</a> for several core header and footer patterns. The following is a short video clip of how this works:</p>\n\n\n\n<div>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>As any theme developer knows, you cannot simply plop anything into the header and make it look good. It is one of the most specialized areas of theme design. One wrong turn and the entire design falls apart. The downside to this feature will be third-party patterns coming from the directory. Some will work. Others will not fit into every theme design, but they are not necessarily meant to. It could be a support nightmare for theme authors or an opportunity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme developers will be able to steer their own ship, offering a range of choices that are perfectly molded to their designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>I can already see it&hellip;multipurpose themes with 50+ header patterns listed in their marketing material.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it is unlikely that many people had this in mind during the conceptual stages of block patterns, they are evolving. They will be more than just something users can stick into their post content at random. They are that semi-controlled experience that will give users the flexibility of choice, but the theme serves as a guide for making intelligent decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a theme author offers four or five well-designed Header or Footer template patterns, users are more likely to select from those. It is easier than building from the ground up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Such a system also opens more <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-system-will-create-more-commercial-opportunities-for-wordpress-theme-authors\">commercial opportunities</a>. Imagine upselling specialized pattern collections for niches. A restaurant site header might want to focus on an &ldquo;order online&rdquo; button. A news website could feature a &ldquo;latest stories&rdquo; ticker above the site title and navigation. There are endless ideas, all awaiting a savvy theme developer to implement and monetize them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As always, I am eager to see where patterns go. They are still the most exciting WordPress feature, offering the API that theme authors have needed for the past decade.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 01 Jul 2021 02:06:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:44;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: WP Engine Makes Local Pro Free for All Users\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119329\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:153:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-makes-local-pro-free-for-all-users?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wp-engine-makes-local-pro-free-for-all-users\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3025:\"<p>WP Engine <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/blog/wp-engine-supercharges-wordpress-development-local-pro-free-for-everyone/?utm_medium=organicsocial&utm_source=twitter\">announced</a> today that Local Pro, the commercial upgrade for its local WordPress development product, is now free for all users.

Shortly after, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/markdown-comment-block/\">Markdown Comment Block</a> plugin appeared on WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is a one-off block. It allows users to enter notes directly into the post editor that will not appear on the front end of the site. Tabor said he came up with the idea when working on an article for building single-block plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are few things I love more than simple plugins with a tight focus, performing a single function. Markdown Comment Block lands in this category.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin creates a new block that works nearly the same as a typical Paragraph block:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Adding inline comments to a post.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can change the text color, but they will not have access to the typical Rich Text controls. Those should be unnecessary anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As someone who does long-form writing almost exclusively in Markdown, the block&rsquo;s use of the double percent-sign syntax for comments intrigued me. Technically, the Markdown spec does not support any sort of special characters for them. It handles HTML comments. However, those appear in the source code on the front end when the document is rendered. I have only seen the <code>%%</code> mark to denote comments in the <a href=\"https://www.inspire-writer.com/\">Inspire Writer</a> app for Windows. Tabor said he had seen the same in <a href=\"https://ulysses.app/\">Ulysses</a>. The feature also exists in the <a href=\"https://useiceberg.com/\">Iceberg editor</a> for WordPress, which Tabor created alongside Jeffrey Carandang.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also introduces the <code>%%</code> keyboard shortcut. Typing it directly in the editor will create a new Markdown Comment block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My primary use case for the plugin would be leaving notes for my later self. However, it could also be handy in users&rsquo; publishing flows. The block adds a &ldquo;Resolve&rdquo; button to the toolbar. Clicking it deletes the comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Clicking the &ldquo;Resolve&rdquo; button will delete the block.\n\n\n\n<p>The block itself will not likely offer a robust enough feature set for complex workflows. However, pairing it with a plugin like <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/upgrade-your-publishing-flow-with-the-post-descriptions-wordpress-plugin\">Post Descriptions</a> could round out the experience for larger teams of writers and copyeditors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Post Descriptions plugin allows users to add notes on the post level. These notes appear on the post-management screen, letting other team members know when to check an article. However, it may be hard to provide the full context of what issues need to be resolved before publishing. Markdown Comment Block adds an inline comments system, letting team members pass in-text notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Theme developers should appreciate that the block uses CSS custom properties too, which makes it easy to overwrite its default style rules.  In moments, I was able to make it match my theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom color, font, and line-height styles.\n\n\n\n<p>The <code>--markdown-comment-font-size</code>, <code>--markdown-comment-line-height</code>, and <code>--markdown-comment-color</code> variables are available for theme developers who want to add in support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one complaint I had about the block is its title: &ldquo;Comment.&rdquo; It is easy to confuse it with the six other comment-related blocks already in the WordPress block list. And, there will only be more in upcoming versions. Giving it a title of &ldquo;Markdown Comment&rdquo; would better distinguish it from others.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 00:15:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:113:\"WPTavern: BuddyPress 9.0 Scheduled for Short Development Cycle to Ship Block-Based Widgets Ahead of WordPress 5.8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119255\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:271:\"https://wptavern.com/buddypress-9-0-scheduled-for-short-development-cycle-to-ship-block-based-widgets-ahead-of-wordpress-5-8?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=buddypress-9-0-scheduled-for-short-development-cycle-to-ship-block-based-widgets-ahead-of-wordpress-5-8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3801:\"<p><a href=\"https://buddypress.org/2021/06/buddypress-8-0-0-alfano/\">BuddyPress 8.0</a> was just released earlier this month on June 6, but the core development team is gearing up for a <a href=\"https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2021/06/24/bp-dev-chat-summary-june-23-2021/\">short development cycle for 9.0</a>. The release will be specifically targeted at getting BuddyPress core widgets ready for WordPress 5.8&rsquo;s new block widgets experience. Contributors are aiming to hit the following timeline to ship 9.0 before the next major WordPress release:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Beta: July 8.</li><li>RC: July 12.</li><li>Final:&nbsp;<strong>July 16</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>BuddyPress entered the world of blocks with the release of version 6.0 in May 2020, allowing users to insert a specific Member or Group into content. Version 7.0, released six months later, introduced blocks for featuring a list of members, a list of groups, and the ability to embed a public activity post. Over the next few weeks, BuddyPress contributors will continue the process of <a href=\"https://github.com/buddypress/bp-blocks/issues/37\">migrating the rest of the BuddyPress component widgets to blocks</a>. These include the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Blogs Recent Posts Widget</strong>: A list of recently published posts from across the network</li><li><strong>BP Core Login Widget</strong>: Shows a Log In form to logged-out visitors, and a Log Out link to those who are logged in</li><li><strong>BP Core Friends Widget</strong>: A dynamic list of recently active, popular, and newest Friends of the displayed member. Widget is only shown when viewing a member profile</li><li><strong>BP Groups Widget</strong>: A dynamic list of recently active, popular, newest, or alphabetical groups</li><li><strong>BP Core Members Widget</strong>: A dynamic list of recently active, popular, and newest members</li><li><strong>BP Core Recently Active Widget</strong>: Profile photos of recently active members</li><li><strong>BP Core Who&rsquo;s Online Widget</strong>: Profile photos of online users</li><li><strong>BP Messages Sitewide Notices Widget</strong>: Display Sitewide Notices posted by the site administrator</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>BP Nouveau widgets:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>BP Latest Activities</strong>: Display the latest updates of your community having the types of your choice</li><li><strong>BP Nouveau Navigation Widget</strong>: Displays BuddyPress primary nav in the sidebar of the site. (Must be used as the first widget of the sidebar and only once.)</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to building a block for every BuddyPress widget, contributors are aiming to make it possible to <a href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/8496\">transform existing BP widgets into their corresponding BP block</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the new block widgets screen imminently landing in WordPress, BuddyPress has to make this move forward to keep pace with the progress of the block editor&rsquo;s march beyond use in the content editor. Otherwise, BuddyPress users would need to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classic-widgets-plugin-disables-wordpress-5-8s-upcoming-block-based-widgets-system\">disable block widgets with the Classic Widgets plugin</a> in order to maintain access to BuddyPress core widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors are also working on creating a new Follow component, a frequently requested feature which would use the now abandoned <a href=\"https://github.com/r-a-y/buddypress-followers\">BuddyPress Follow</a> plugin as inspiration. The feature will work similar to Twitter following or the Facebook follow button that allows users to see public activity posts for those they are following. The Follow component is being built as a plugin first and will ship with 9.0 if it is ready in time.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 01:07:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: Diving Into WordPress 5.8’s New Widgets Screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=119259\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:155:\"https://wptavern.com/diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diving-into-wordpress-5-8s-new-widgets-screen\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6657:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">It has been a while since I have touched widgets. Once the site editor landed in the Gutenberg plugin, I almost exclusively dropped the old sidebar paradigm and moved to block templates. Reactivating old themes and jumping into the widgets screen felt like time-traveling into a bygone era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of being deeply embedded within block themes, it is hard to imagine moving back to the sidebar widgets system that most WordPress users are still using today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-5-8-beta-1-released-new-blocks-new-widgets-screen-and-pattern-directory-on-deck\">WordPress 5.8 is slated to ship</a> with a small taste of bringing blocks outside of the content editor. However, it can feel like a surface-level refresh of a dying system, one that does not always work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Block-based widgets are part of the transitional phase between classic WordPress and the future, which centers on a complete site editor. Once the bulk of themes are built atop blocks, the need for widgets will wane. The site editor and block themes do not support the old sidebar system. Instead, users will be able to place blocks anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last October, I asked the question: <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/are-block-based-widgets-ready-to-land-in-wordpress-5-6\">Are Block-Based Widgets Ready To Land in WordPress 5.6?</a> At the time, the widgets screen was expected to launch with the final release of 2020. However, the development team pulled back on the feature&rsquo;s inclusion, primarily because the customizer implementation was sub-par.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asking the same question of WordPress 5.8, my answer is mostly the same. It is time to ship the current feature and prepare for a future without widgets. There are so many components that are far more exciting around the corner. The primary user-experience issues will linger around until users have moved on to block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have long been in the camp of starting from a clean slate for block themes, letting widgets die out. However, the path WordPress has chosen is to create this stepping stone for users who may be on traditional themes for a while. It provides an opportunity to use blocks outside of the editor, which may be a leap forward for many.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the vast number of libraries, one-off blocks, and support from plugin authors, users have a wealth of block choices at their fingertips. Right now, if there is no equivalent widget, those users can only ever use those blocks in their content. Within a block-widget system, that limitation does not exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also lifts some burdens from developers. Those who want to shed some of their old code and go all-in on blocks can begin considering deprecating or retiring widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Transitioning to the new Widgets screen should feel simple to users familiar with the WordPress content editor. Inserting blocks is the same. The difference is that each sidebar has its own container.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Widgets screen with a Gallery block in the Footer sidebar.\n\n\n\n<p>The range of blocks within core WordPress could also let users drop some of their widgets-based plugins. One of the most popular types of widgets over the years has been for handling post lists. There are dozens of such plugins and an untold number of themes that include one. Coupled with WordPress 5.8&rsquo;s Query Loop block, users can now recreate many of those widgets themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Custom post list using the Query Loop block.\n\n\n\n<p>Much of this depends on the theme&rsquo;s design support of blocks and whether it will accommodate anything other than traditional widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Customizer support for block widgets is lightyears ahead of where it was just a few short months ago. However, it feels awkward at best. There is a deep feeling of not belonging. While it was a remarkable programming feat to make the two features work together, the user experiences are nearly a decade apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Editing a Heading block in the customizer.\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the customizer providing a live preview, the Widgets screen in the WordPress admin gives the necessary workspace. Trying to squeeze the block editor into the tiny customize controls panel was never going to be an ideal experience, and it still is not. It gets the job done, but I recommend the traditional widgets screen for fewer headaches.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Problems Remain</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">In the eight months since I first dived into the block-based widgets, the system has been overhauled. However, the potential issues I brought up remain. Just dropping blocks into a sidebar can have mixed results. For example, compare a Legacy Widget to Heading and Latest Comments blocks in the footer sidebar of the popular OceanWP theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Mismatched headings and colors.\n\n\n\n<p>The issue is that WordPress treats every block as a widget. Traditionally, widgets have had both a title and content. Blocks have no such concept. A Heading followed by something like a Paragraph, Latest Comments, or another block has no special meaning in the block system. They are all treated separately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This issue is in full view when adding blocks to the default Twenty Twenty-One WordPress theme:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Block treated as widget in Twenty Twenty-One footer sidebar.\n\n\n\n<p>Notice the Heading and Latest Comments blocks are columnized because they are seen as separate widgets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To address this, users must add multiple blocks into a Group block if they want them treated as a single &ldquo;widget.&rdquo; It is a simple matter, but it could still be a usability hurdle for some.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even with a fix in place, there is no guarantee that blocks will appear as the widgets the theme author intended.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I long ago gave up on the hope that there would be better handling for block widgets. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/classic-widgets-plugin-disables-wordpress-5-8s-upcoming-block-based-widgets-system\">Classic Widgets plugin</a> is available for those who need it, and <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/widgets/opting-out/#using-remove_theme_support\">theme authors can opt-out</a>. These are necessary tools for an experience that can range from downright awesome to utterly broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing blocks outside of the content editor for traditional theme users is probably necessary for the transition, but the current site editor experience already feels much smoother than block widgets. The long-term focus should be on moving away from the dated concept of widgets and into a WordPress front-end 100% built on blocks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 23:52:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Gutenberg Times: Theme.json Resources, Block Patterns and WordPress 5.8 – Weekend Edition #175\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18320\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/theme-json-resources-block-patterns-and-wordpress-5-8-weekend-edition-175/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13004:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We enjoy cooling off at the community pool after our lunch walks.

She shared some of her learn lessons on running the FSE outreach program and what needs to happen to make this a permanent contributor activity within WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here is the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/06/09/upcoming-fse-outreach-program-schedule-june-july/\">Upcoming FSE Outreach Program Schedule</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/scruffian\"><strong>Ben Dwyer</strong> </a>on ThemeShaper posted <strong><a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2021/06/23/universal-themes-some-ideas/\">Some Ideas for Universal Themes</a>.</strong> He wrote: &#8220;A universal theme would work in both editing modes.&nbsp; A user should be able to build a site in classic mode and switch to FSE mode when the Site Editor is more mature or when they are ready to try all the extra tools that Full Site Editing will bring. Changes to a theme in classic mode should be reflected when I enable the Site Editor.&#8221; and goes into more details on how that could work.

There are wonderful and useful patterns, you can use for your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The discussion about <strong>Block Patterns</strong> on the WordPress Tavern has readers ruminating about <strong><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-theme-lock-in-silos-and-the-block-system\">Theme Lock-In, Silos, and the Block System</a>.</strong> In a Post Status discussion, <strong>Tammie Lister </strong>thought the opposite is true. &#8220;it&#8217;s going to be easier, not harder, to switch with the newer set up.&#8221; And then she continues: &#8220;Try swapping between themes now. It&#8217;s not a picnic. It&#8217;s often a sad rained on picnic with soggy sandwiches of sadness, even with the best hope.&#8221; 🌧️ I might steal that metaphor from Tammie 💕</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Block Patterns, the design team also brought Block Patterns to all WordPress Twenty themes, all the way back to Twenty-Ten. They will be released with WordPress 5.8. <strong>Milana Cap</strong> published about these <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/21/bundled-themes-changes-in-wordpress-5-8/\">Bundled themes changes in WordPress 5.8</a>.</strong> They are a great inspiration for designer on what can be possible with Block Patterns now. Justin Tadlock at the WordPress Tavern also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/a-throwback-to-the-past-refreshing-old-twenty-wordpress-themes-with-block-patterns\">took the new patterns out for a spin.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <strong><a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2021/06/25/theme-patterns-for-the-site-editor/\">Theme patterns for the Site&nbsp;Editor</a> </strong> <strong>Kjell Reigstad</strong> show off a new UI to handle the display of different patterns for a header. It is an expansion of the block pattern display for Query Loop for various Post list layouts. He also shared his code and a short tutorial. Kjell also used the Quadrat theme from the Automattic repository </p>\n\n\n\n\nHeader Patterns in Quadrat Theme / Automattic\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Development and Plugins</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For block builders, the Core-editor team published two DevNotes this week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/23/block-api-enhancements-in-wordpress-5-8/\">Block API Enhancements in WordPress 5.8</a> </strong>by <strong>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</strong>, encouraging plugins developers to using the block.json metadata file.

Great and quick customer support, thank you for helping me solve problem!</li>\n<li>I had paid good money for the leading gallery plugin. But it didn’t create links of the photos so I could send people to a shopping cart for that image. Modula does. BIG advantage. Plus the customer service is top notch. Thanks Modula!</li>\n<li>There is a lot of gallery plugins but for some reason, they are not 100% masonry – they layout the photos often in an ugly way, and not at an even height. This plugin makes a perfect masonry, what is the main reason I use it.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Still not convinced?

We encourage you to take a look at other gallery plugins, but one thing you&#8217;ll notice is that <strong>they all look the same&#8230;</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Sick and tired of boring galleries? Make your own and stand out with Modula.</strong><br />\nGalleries created with Modula don&#8217;t always look identical. With the Modula custom grid functionality, you can easily adjust the size and aspect ratio of each individual image by dragging from the bottom right-hand corner in the gallery edit area.<br />\nCustom grids give you greater flexibility over how you display the images on your website. Easily control the size and look of your gallery &#8211; choosing the images you want to stand out, rather than relying on an algorithm.<br />\nYes, that means you don&#8217;t have to worry about your gallery awkwardly cropping out your subject or your subject not being at the center of the image.</p>\n<p><strong>Modula is the most powerful, customizable and easy-to-use WordPress gallery plugin</strong> available because we give you the power to choose everything from the height and width of your gallery down to resizing individual images within the container that makes sure your images never exceed the content area.</p>\n<p><strong>Ease-of-use shouldn&#8217;t mean sample/basic Galleries</strong><br />\nModula has been designed to be user-friendly from the ground up so that users of varying WordPress experience can easily create the perfect WordPress photo, video and image galleries.<br />\nIf you don&#8217;t want all the customization features, you can leave everything up to the algorithm, and if you do &#8211; they&#8217;re there so you can easily choose gallery size, margins between images, the color and size of captions.<br />\nIf you can&#8217;t seem to figure something out, you can always check our <a href=\"https://wp-modula.com/docs\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">documentation</a> or <a href=\"https://wp-modula.com/contact-us\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">get in touch</a> &#8211; we&#8217;re always happy to help&#8230;</p>\n<h3>3rd party or external service disclaimer</h3>\n<p>The plugin sends data (User action) to our website through an API Call (https://tracking.wp-modula.com/).</p>\n<p>The plugin connects to our website through an API call (https://wp-modula.com/wp-json/mt/v1/get-all-extensions) in order to request a list of available extensions.</p>\n<p><strong>Modula Gallery does not send any data without consent or user action to our website, nor do we collect sensitive information from the requests.</strong></p>\n<p>Our full privacy policy can be found <a href=\"https://wp-modula.com/privacy-policy/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">here</a>.</p>\n\";s:12:\"installation\";s:1200:\"<h4>For automatic installation:</h4>\n<p>The simplest way to install is to click on \\&#8217;Plugins\\&#8217; then \\&#8217;Add\\&#8217; and type \\&#8217;Modula\\&#8217; in the search field.</p>\n<h4>For manual installation 1:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Login to your website and go to the Plugins section of your admin panel.</li>\n<li>Click the Add New button.</li>\n<li>Under Install Plugins, click the Upload link.</li>\n<li>Select the plugin zip file (modula.x.x.x.zip) from your computer then click the Install Now button.</li>\n<li>You should see a message stating that the plugin was installed successfully.</li>\n<li>Click the Activate Plugin link.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>For manual installation 2:</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>You should have access to the server where WordPress is installed.

Everything else will be inherited from your theme.</p>\n<p>Some templates have light &amp; dark versions and other options. If you want to customize things like fonts, margins and borders, you will need custom CSS.</p>\n<h3>Testimonial Submission Form</h3>\n<p>This plugin provides one form with custom fields. Customize the form by adding or removing fields and changing properties like the order, label, and placeholder.</p>\n<p>Send custom notification emails to multiple admins.</p>\n<p>Submit the form via Ajax for use with plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/popup-maker/\">Popup Maker</a>.</p>\n<h3>Displaying Testimonials</h3>\n<p><strong>Everything happens in a View</strong>. Instead of learning multiple shortcodes with dozens of options, a View contains all the options in a simple, intuitive editor that no other testimonial plugin has.</p>\n<p>Create unlimited views. For example, one view for a form, another for a static grid, another for a slideshow, and so on.</p>\n<p>Display a view using a shortcode or the widget.</p>\n<p>A variety of templates are included that work well in most themes.</p>\n<p>For ultimate control and seamless integration, copy any template to your theme and customize it.</p>\n<p>The template function will add a view to your custome theme templates:</p>\n<pre><code>&lt;?php if ( function_exists( \'strong_testimonials_view\' ) ) {\n    strong_testimonials_view( $id );\n} ?&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Privacy and GDPR</h3>\n<p>By default, this plugin:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>does not store any user or visitor data,</li>\n<li>does not send any data to remote servers, act as a service or embed content,</li>\n<li>does not edit the comments form in any way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The plugin also prevents displaying email addresses in your testimonials on the front end.</p>\n<p>However, this plugin provides features that may involve private data.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you use the testimonial submission form, the data collected on that form will be stored in your database.</li>\n<li>If you enable the administrator notification email upon new testimonial submission, the data collected on your form, at your selection, may be included in that notification email.</li>\n<li>If you enable comments on testimonials, the plugin will use your theme&#8217;s single post template and comment form.</li>\n<li>If you embed third-party posts such as Twitter, YouTube and FaceBook in your testimonials, you will be agreeing to the Terms of Use of those third-party sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Try these plugins too</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wider-admin-menu/\">Wider Admin Menu</a> lets your admin menu b r e a t h e.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>3rd party or external service disclaimer</h3>\n<p>The plugin connects to our website through an API call (https://strongtestimonials/wp-json/mt/v1/get-all-extensions) in order to request a list of available extensions.</p>\n<p>IT DOES NOT SEND ANY DATA NOR DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM THE REQUEST</p>\n<p>Our privacy policy can be found at this URL https://strongtestimonials.com/privacy-policy/</p>\n\";s:12:\"installation\";s:348:\"<ol>\n<li>Go to Plugins &gt; Add New.</li>\n<li>Search for &#8220;strong testimonials&#8221;.</li>\n<li>Click &#8220;Install Now&#8221;.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>OR</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the zip file.</li>\n<li>Upload the zip file via Plugins &gt; Add New &gt; Upload.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Activate the plugin.

class=\"review-body\">Plugin good at first glance. \n\nThe main problem I have is that it isn\'t perfect for membership site, hopefully they can fix this.\n\nIf a WP user creates a support ticket, but enters a different email address than the one on their account, KB-Support doesn\'t link this \"KB-Support customer\" to WP user, instead creates a new \"customer\" in KB Support. \nThis makes for a lot of extra work trying to find the actual WP user (when trying to change their details, or fix account problems, etc), especially a problem for me running a membership website.\n\nI have tried deleting the duplicate KB-Support customer, changing the email address of the other KB-Support customer to the new one (matching the WP user email address), and it still doesn\'t link to the WP user.\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n	<div class=\"review-head\">\n		<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n			<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n				<h4 class=\"review-title\">Great

I leave a long exhaustive review about how incredibly amazing (and refreshing), not only this plugin, its features, its ease of use, its clean design, but of it\'s incredible support! Holy cow! This isn\'t an exaggeration, not at all. Support that you can get with this is worth twice any of the paid extensions and priceless over the ability to install this for free with an already impressive set of features out of the gate. I\'m talking features that are paid extensions for other \"popular\" ticketing systems. I mean, there\'s even a couple minor conveniences that others don\'t even have as paid extensions. We utilize a certain Knowledge Base that wasn\'t in the list and are tied to it with the best of loyalties and love. So naturally I am curious as to their little addition about how they welcome the offer to request others. I gave in. I opened a ticket with my little quirks and passive aggressive desires... and guess what... It\'s getting worked on for inclusion. So fast that I saw their email coming in acknowledging it, but not just that, with a little packaged test runner. *GASP*. Have you ever? I certainly haven\'t. I haven\'t even responded to their ticket wherein I thank them and offer my first born grandchild, so this is a surprise to them in return. \n\nThere is nothing more refreshing than opting for an in house Ticketing system that additionally offers such amazing support, skilled developers, and turnkey solutions that you have a hard time finding through other vendors. I\'d give all the stars in the sky for this if I could. These guys need more notoriety for their product. The others may get you with their glitz and glamour, but dig deep and you\'ll see they are just money pits with stale articles and stale development. 100% real deal here and I\'m officially a loyal fan.\n\n2. It\'s great yeah, so what are YOU waiting for? You\'re here, you obviously need a solution like this, stop hesitating. 5/5\n\n&lt;3</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n	<div class=\"review-head\">\n		<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n			<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n				<h4 class=\"review-title\">Fantastic support plugin!</h4>\n				<div class=\"star-rating\">\n				<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span></div>				</div>\n			</div>\n			<p class=\"reviewer\">\n				By <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/manni02\"><img alt=\'\' src=\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/42c1ea33f0444409de828d4bb13e1f03?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g\' srcset=\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/42c1ea33f0444409de828d4bb13e1f03?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x\' class=\'avatar avatar-16 photo\' height=\'16\' width=\'16\' loading=\'lazy\'/></a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/manni02\" class=\"reviewer-name\">Manni02</a> on <span class=\"review-date\">March 18, 2021</span>			</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"review-body\">Great support plugin, and most importantly great support from KB-Support!\n\nThanks and keep up the good work!</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"review\">\n	<div class=\"review-head\">\n		<div class=\"reviewer-info\">\n			<div class=\"review-title-section\">\n				<h4 class=\"review-title\">Prompt Support</h4>\n				<div class=\"star-rating\">\n				<div class=\"wporg-ratings\" aria-label=\"5 out of 5 stars\" data-title-template=\"%s out of 5 stars\" data-rating=\"5\" style=\"color:#ffb900;\"><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span><span class=\"star dashicons dashicons-star-filled\"></span></div>				</div>\n			</div>\n			<p class=\"reviewer\">\n				By <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jwcomley\"><img alt=\'\' src=\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/40c043e03716491a18f32597dece248d?s=16&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g\' srcset=\'https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/40c043e03716491a18f32597dece248d?s=32&#038;d=monsterid&#038;r=g 2x\' class=\'avatar avatar-16 photo\' height=\'16\' width=\'16\' loading=\'lazy\'/></a><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jwcomley\" class=\"reviewer-name\">jwcomley</a> on <span class=\"review-date\">December 15, 2019</span>			</p>\n		</div>\n	</div>\n	<div class=\"review-body\">KB support Plugin works great.
